Present: SJ, JB

Discussion:
*   Successful first demo of GNT SQLite. Parsed Ephesians into SQLite. A few
    bugs to work out for next week. The goal is to combine everything for
    command-line use into a single 'gnt' script. 
*   Sketch out a paper for a wide (but interested) audience. A working title:
    "Is the Bible relevant today?". Show a big-picture overview of the Bible.
    Clearly get the point across that most of the Bible doesn't have anything to
    do with us today (but is important for our learning). The key to what is
    relevant is understanding what was actually written to us!
*   Possible topics for Alpha group:
        - Faith: which target are you looking at?
        - Grace: what is it?
*   Discussed the importance of meeting people face-to-face to share The
    Mystery. We think the university crowd will be especially interested.

Action:
*   SJ: Continue work on 'gnt' python tool. Add commands to download texts and
    populate SQLite with all books.
*   SJ/JB: Begin brainstorming on paper.
