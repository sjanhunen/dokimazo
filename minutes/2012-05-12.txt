Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   The will of the Father in Ephesians
    *   7 references in Eph: 6 positive, 1 negative
    *   Paul speaks as though it is plain, understandable, and doable
    *   Why do we have a hard time understanding what it is?
    *   Paul's prayers are clearly focused on understanding God's will:
        we should be asking God for this understanding
    *   Perhaps God wants us to ask Him for understanding
*   Understanding Christ's redemptive work more
    *   Compare redemption from Egypt to Christ's work on the cross
        *   Passover (blood shed, death and resurrection)
        *   Armies spoiled
    *   Understand the vertical transitions that Christ went through
        *   Pitched the tent in heavens
        *   Came down to earth
        *   Died, buried, resurrected
        *   Ascended back to tent
        *   Spoiled armies
        *   Came back to earth to preach the peace in Eph
        *   Ascended far above all heavens

*   SJ: Make initial sketch: vertical picture of Christ's redemptive work
*   SJ/JB: Read Eph in ESV
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
