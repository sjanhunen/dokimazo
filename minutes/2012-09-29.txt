Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Idea: Produce a short 10-15min video (voice with illustration). A good
    first topic to present would be 'What is Redemption?'
*   Consider holding next year's conference on Memorial Day weekend: this could
    possibly be less busy for quite a few people
*   Start a beginner's track next year (or at least have some sessions
    targeted specifically at beginners)
*   Special topic for next year: The Parables!
*   Kingdom of the Heavens: putting the Divine government order back in place

Action:
*   Start studying The Parables: identify the list of Parables
*   Begin to consider Ephesians breakdown for next year's conference
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
