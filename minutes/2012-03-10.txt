Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Exo 13: glory cloud filling the tabernacle/temple
*   Glory was missing from the temple when Christ came to earth
*   Some OT references to re-building temple:
    *   New Temple built Zech 6:12
    *   "Day of small things" in Haggai 2:7-9
    *   What is the location of the rebuilt temple? Look at Eze 40-48.
*   Eph and Col: the post-temple books
*   Why was the Veil of the Temple Rent:
    *   To allow access to the holiest?
    *   To see that God's glory wasn't present?
*   Is there a difference between a temple built during Israel's pre-eminance
    versus one built during Israel's subjection
*   Some clarity on the Kingdom of Heaven:
    *   Kingdom Jesus talked about on earth wasn't put into play yet
        *   Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand (King was there)
        *   Luke 21:27-31: kingdom of God is nigh when all this happened
    *   Contrast to us translated into His Kingdom:
        *   Versus Col 1:13: translated into the kingdom of His dear Son

Action:
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
