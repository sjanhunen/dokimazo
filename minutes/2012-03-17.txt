Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Christ's two comings and the two covenants: taking away the first that
    He may establish the second. See Heb 10:9. Many people recognize that
    Christ came to setup something new. But it seems that that is what His
    second coming is about. We cannot forget that He first had to take
    away the old. Didn't His cross work take away the old and pay the
    price (the Blood) for the new?
*   Also to compare: the coming Kingdom and the coming New Covenant. While
    the blood has been shed, neither of these has been fully setup yet.
    Recall the feasts of Israel that still must take place: Trumpets,
    Atonement, and Tabernacle.
*   Clear evidence that the Old Covenant was vanishing but had not quite
    yet disappeared: Heb 8:13 and Heb 7:12.
*   Compare the Kingdom in the Gospels and in Col:
    *   The Kingdom Jesus talked about on earth wasn't in play yet
        *   Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand (the King was there)
        *   Luke 21:27-31: kingdom of God is nigh when all this happens
    *   Believers from that time will need to be resurrected to enter into
        this Kingdom.
    *   In Col 1:13, we see that we have already been translated into the
        'Kingdom of His dear Son'. For us, it's already done! But it's
        also a different aspect of the kingdom He is focusing on today.
*   Considering born again and the New Covenant:
    *   Born is begotten from something else (children are born).
    *   Created is something new (Adam was not born).
    *   Are we ever 'born again'? Or is the focus on a new creation only?
*   God's goal: Compare 1 Cor 15:28 and Eph 1:10. These are some
    big-picture verses that definitely require more study.
