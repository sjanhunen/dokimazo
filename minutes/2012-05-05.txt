Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Who was Paul writing to in Eph 2:11?
    *   It doesn't make sense that these were saved Gentiles, grafted into the
        olive tree of Israel
    *   It makes more sense if this is a totally new group of people
    *   He's not offering them a part of the hope of Israel but something
        entirely new
*   Compare Eph 1:22 to Heb 2:8 and Cor:
    *   Heb and Cor look forward to things being put under Christ's feet in the
        earthly realm (not yet accomplished)
    *   Eph 1:22 shows that all things have been put under His feet (done deal)
        as far as the super heavenly realm is concerned
*   Conference Planning
