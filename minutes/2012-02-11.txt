Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   The Middle Wall: what does *broken down* (lyo) mean in Eph 2:14?
    *   This word is often translated "loosed" or to "loose".
    *   A key verse is John 2:19: "destroy this temple...I will raise it up".
    *   There is clear evidence that something that is *destroyed* can be
        brought back again in the future.
    *   The Temple is quite literally destroyed today. The middle wall is
        physically broken. But someday there will be another temple.
    *   Currently, there is no distinction between Isral and the other
        nations, but this is definitely not the case in the book of Rev.
*   Death and Resurrection key to understanding The Covenants and The Covenant
    People! It appears that even the temple itself goes through a "death" and
    "resurrection".
*   Relevance: Today, we see everything associated with the Old Covenant
    destroyed and buried. Nothing (except Christ Himself) has been resurrected
    yet. What is going on while the covnant purpose sleeps?
*   When the nations "knew God" but failed to glorify Him as God in Rom, it is
    possible that this was a much closer and more personal encounter. Think of
    Adam and Eve, Cain and Able, and Noah.

Action:
*   SJ: Second demo of gnt tool for next weekend.
*   SJ/JB: Continue brainstorming on paper.
