Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Discussed prayers in Ephesians: makes sense if they are focused on
    on inheritance
*   Decided on flow for relevance talk at conference:
    1.  Introduce relevance with example/sketch:
        We become relevant to God's purpose, not the other way around
    2.  Present the timeline of purpose:
        The Mystery covers the gap that's not apparent from prophecy
    3.  Present the vertical picture of purpose:
        Christ ascended to the highest point, the superheavenlies
*   Consider how we can give examples of relevance to God's purposes
    from the OT, for example
 
Action:
*   SJ: Make initial sketch: vertical picture of Christ's redemptive work
*   SJ/JB: Read Eph in ESV
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
