Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   For the relevance talk, we will show how time and position are critical
    for Christ's roles as Prophet, Priest, and King. This leads directly into
    the fact that time and position are critical for His role as Head.
*   Christ could not be a Priest while on earth (didn't have the lineage), but
    He could in heaven. That's one reason He had to ascend.
*   Is it significant that the marriage supper takes place after the harvest?
    It makes sense to get the work done before the feast and celebration.
*   Adam and Eve had a unique relationship that marriage can only typify.
    She was taken directly out of Adam. She was his wife without ever being a
    bride or going through marriage. This must tie into the fact that Paul goes
    right back to Adam/Eve when discussing the relationship between Christ and
    His Body in Eph 5.
*   It would be beneficial to figure out a way to include temple, church,
    body, bride, and wife on our chart of Christ's positions (time and place).
