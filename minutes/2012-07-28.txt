Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   For introduction, need to show how particular parts of the Bible (plan)
    are important (not just any part)
*   Perpahs base a small sketch on several people playing a game together
    (wrong instructions, right instructions, right part of instructions)
*   For horizontal picture
    *   Start in the Gospels (Luke) and only bring in OT as necessary
    *   Covenant and distinction between Jew/Gentile go hand in hand
    *   The state of temple is strongest indicator of state of Israel
    *   Kingdom wasn't going to come until the Son came: Luke 21:27-31
    *   Mysteries fill in the gaps in Scripture (not evident before revealed)
* Vertical picture
    *   This picture builds as a pyramid on the current horizontal diagram
    *   Where Christ is tracks with what he is doing

Action:
*   SJ: Continue working on diagrams for conference introduction 
*   SJ/JB: Read through the parables in light of Acts period
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
