Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Eph 4:10: missing from 4:8 - this was hidden when Psalms was written
*   Do we fill up Christ or does He fill us up:
*   Eph 1:23 vs Col 2:10
*   Is there an analogy with Israel wating for Messiah and ability to be
    kingdom of priests vs where we sit in our life right now?
*   Tag-team into:
    *   The Bible: God makes us relevant to His Plans!
        Is God Goal/Purpose oriented? God's family business
    *   God's purpose: cleaning up the mess from the overthrow
    *   The Big Picture: timeline versus vertical picture with Christ

Action:
*   SJ: Make initial sketch: vertical picture of Christ's redemptive work
*   SJ/JB: Read Eph in ESV
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
