Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Introduction session for the Conference:
    *   Tag-team format with some Q&A
    *   More scripted than last time 
    *   Hit the big-picture concepts around The Mystery
    *   Appropriate level so video could be shown to new believers
*   Mystery in Eph:
    *   The Mystery of His Will (1:9)
    *   The Mystery (3:3)
    *   The Mystery of Christ (3:4)
    *   The Fellowship of the Mystery (3:9)
    *   A Great Mystery (5:32)
    *   The Mystery of the Gospel (6:19)
*   The Promise in Eph 1 must relate to the picture in Eph 1:22 and form some
    larger part of what is discussed in Heb 1:30.
*   How do blessing, inheritance, and love relate in Scrpiture? For example,
    it seems that manifestation of the Father's love is closely aligned with
    giving of a blessing/inheritance.
*   What made Christ different than the angels in Heb?
    *   Son
    *   Inheritance
    *   Angels worship Him
    *   Enemies made His footstool
    *   Appointed over the house
*   The Father made a promise to the Son. Jehovah made a promise to Abraham. As
    part of The Mystery, we can share in the promise the Father made to the Son.
    We are strangers to the promises made to the fathers.
