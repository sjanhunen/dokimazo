Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Building a GNT search tool using SqLite. Demo for next week. Consider
    Groovy/Grails later as a way to build a web front-end to the database.
*   The battleground in Eph 6 is in proximity to blessings in Eph 1. You
    must *twist* scripture to show that there is no spiritual wickedness
    in heavenly places (Eph 6:12).
*   Actually laying hold on the blessings was future for Jacob and Israel.
    Doesn't it make sense that this is the case for us too?
*   A diagram showing the separation of Israel from the Nations
    and the reconciling (upwards) into the New Man. More refinement is
    necessary.  This could be an excellent approach to explaining the
    Bible in one page and then highlighting "The Mystery".

Action Items:
*   SJ: Prepare SqLite GNT demo for next week.
*   JB: Get VM ready to run demo
