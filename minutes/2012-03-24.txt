Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   How does the Holy Spirit teach us today?
    *   Important to remember that when the disciples were alive, the
        Scriptures were not yet fully written. Leading into all truth
        was absolutely necessary.
    *   We understand that today being "filled with the Spirit" is closely
        aligned with the "Word of Christ dwelling" in us (Eph and Col). If
        we don't open the Bible and read, how can we possibly have this?
*   Question: What is God's purpose today?
    *   Critical to understand this to understand relevance today.
    *   Consider Israel as an allegory that helps us understand our books.
    *   How much do we really know about our future work as members of the
        Body of Christ? How much have we been told?
    *   Why is there a priesthood? Do we somehow have a role like this but
        in the super heavens?
    *   The Temple (as a dwelling place) seems to be a common thread.
*   Important notes for Ephesians conference:
    *   Eph 4:11: We can't just pick and choose.
    *   Eph 4:13: This has already happened.

Action:
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
