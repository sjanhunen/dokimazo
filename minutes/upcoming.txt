Number crunching on Faith, Hope, Love
* Faith x244 (174x by Paul)
* Hope x54 (not mentioned in Philemon and 2 Timothy)
* Love x116 (77x by Paul)
* Look at Love in NT and OT
* Study love in context of relationship

Mar 30
------
* God's Love is targeted
* There are plenty of things God hates in scripture
* What about those that hate God?
* A correct understanding of kosmos is required to understand John 3:16
* Which world 'order' is kosmos referring to?
* This life as preparation for standing for the evil day
* You get several changes to learn your lession
* But God won't put you where you aren't qualified
* Think how often God numbers things: doesn't he need a specific size of army?
* NOTE: Do a study on how many redemptions are associated with Israel

Mar 23
------
* 'Submit' in Eph 5 has the battle (and army) from Eph 6 in view
* God numbering his army: Numbers 1:1-3 (one month after tabernacle)
* Is fullness related to getting a full army?
* Eph 2: 'holy temple' as a phrase only shows up here
* Key: all of the Bible is one big plan!
* Are there 22 books in the Old Testament?
    * 22 sections of Psalm 119, one for each letter
    * 22 books (if they are grouped), one for each letter

Mar 16
------
* Consider the links between
    * Chosen before the overthrow
    * Principalities and powers set aside
    * Saints judging angles (related to power structure change?)
* Before the overthrow is significant in the Mystery
* Big deal: whether angels are on the scene or not changes a lot!

Feb 9
-----

* What does kingdom mean in Ephesians?

Love: (couple of weeks back)

* Blessing related to the realm
* Does God love sinners?
* Is a relationship required for love?
* Are there gradients in agapae?
* Christ had to earn something and He was up to the task
* Think of Abraham: those that bless/curse you I will bless/curse
* Love, life, hope all flow with a relationship in place (faith)
* Working theory: a relationship required for love
* God laid down His life because wanted those that wanted to be part of this
* What does God hate?

Jan 26:
* Blessing and love related closely in Eph 1
* Eph 1:5: adoption is to whom?
* Was Israel ever not under the law?
* What does it mean to be "under the law"?
* Redemption: look at usage in Paul's books
* Purchased possession: what is this? How to translate?


* Earthly Blessing
* Heavenly Blessing

*   Mat 3: John and Repentance.
*   What is the Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven?
*   What is the trigger for the Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven?
*   What was Christ really talking about in the Parables? Do they fit in
    Revelation?
*   Read parables of Mat 18 and compare to Revelation



Dec 15
*   A name that is clear and descriptive
*   Thinking about 
*   What is the linkage between Priest and Covenant? Is Christ our Priest?
*   Sacrifice versus Priest
*   Understand
*   Keep in mind when reading parables: what are the parables? how many?

*   Study the link between Mat 13:35 and Psalm 78:2 more. Is Psalm 78 talking
    about secrets?

*   Theory: the Parables speak of the secrets of the kingdom and in particular
    they fill in the delay between the first and second comings of Christ.
    Christ has new instructions in the parables because the stuff He was
    talking about had been secret since the foundation of the world
    (Mat 13:34-35). Also notice the tie in between the quote from Isaiah
    in Mat 13:13-15 and in Acts 28:25-27.

*   Notice the use of parable in the OT when spoken to 'foolish' or 
    'rebellious'? What is the significance of a parable in the Old Testament?

*   Do the parables give us any hints about what's going on with Paul's
    ministry during the Acts period? Is the Apostle of the Nations
    fulfilling Luke 14:23? Or is that just John's ministry?

*   What is the relationship between Luke 8:10 and Rom 11:25?

*   Is Rom 16:25 related to the 'Mysteries of the Kingdom'?

*   Christ the Prophet in the Gospels, the Great high Priest in Acts,
    and the King of Kings in Revelation. Israel was expecting a king reigning
    immediately. In actual fact, Christ seemed to identify Himself with a 
    prophet's role during the gospels and didn't seem to directly answer to 
    'King of the Jews'. Christ ascended to his Priestly duties 
    (and as an Advocate and Intercessor) during the Acts period.
    One day He will again return as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

*   In Mark 13: is Christ referring to the destruction of the temple in AD 70,
    or is he referring to future judgment at Jerusalem in Revelation?
    The future destruction of the temple makes sense given the context
    From the perspective of It would appear that the temple existed during the
    Acts period and just continued until the antichrist (but in fact it was
    destroyed in AD70 and will have to be rebuilt before the antichrist shows
    up). The Mystery sits in between.

*   What does Mark 13:10 refer to?

*   Consider the OT wilderness period and how the cloud/piller of fire guided
    Israel from heaven (but still in proximity to earth). Then consider the
    Mystery period of the Kingdom (like a second wilderness journey) and
    Christ on high with the tabernacle in heaven.

Brainstorm: important questions regarding The Mystery
* Did Christ's work end when he ascended up to heaven?
* Is your relationship to God based on a covenant or contract?
* Does God view Israel as different from other nations?
* Are you a part of the Bride or the Husband himself?
* Are you waiting for the Marriage of the Lamb, or are you part of Him already?
* Are you waiting to enter the Kingdom, or have you been translated?
* Are you waiting for Christ to return, or are you seated with Him already?
* Do you share in the promise made to Abraham or to the Son Himself?
* How do we know the Bible is complete?
* Is there a God-ordained church hierarchy in place today?
* Does ceremony please God?
* Are we suffering for Chirst today?

Design review for GNT search sets
---------------------------------

All query results returned as sets (immutable collections of unique items).

The GNT can be expressed as sets at different levels of abstraction
    words - subset of the text
    forms - subset of inflected forms
    roots - subset of Strongs roots
    verses - subset of verses
    pos - subset of parts of speech

A search will typically start at one level of abstraction and move to another.
Functions must be used to convert between sets at different levels of
abstraction. The result is always a set (contains no duplicates). This means
that some functions are necessarily one way.

For example, to find all the roots in Eph

    roots(words(verses('eph')))

Set theory can be used on sets at the same level of abstraction. See the set
operators for Python. For example, to find all roots common to Eph and Col

    roots(words(verses('eph'))) & roots(words(verses('col')))

Or to find all roots in Eph and Col

    roots(words(verses('eph') | verses('col')))

Interesting possibilities exist. This would find all root verbs in Eph

    roots(forms(pos('VERB'))) & roots(forms(words(verses('eph'))))

To find all verses in Mat that contain G4172

    verses('mat') & verses(words(forms('G4172')))

We may also consider abbreviated functions. So the previous search may look like

    V('mat') & V(W(F('G4172')))
