Design review for GNT search sets
---------------------------------

All query results returned as sets (immutable collections of unique items).

The GNT can be expressed as sets at different levels of abstraction
    words - subset of the text
    forms - subset of inflected forms
    roots - subset of Strongs roots
    verses - subset of verses
    pos - subset of parts of speech

A search will typically start at one level of abstraction and move to another.
Functions must be used to convert between sets at different levels of
abstraction. The result is always a set (contains no duplicates). This means
that some functions are necessarily one way.

For example, to find all the roots in Eph

    roots(words(verses('eph')))

Set theory can be used on sets at the same level of abstraction. See the set
operators for Python. For example, to find all roots common to Eph and Col

    roots(words(verses('eph'))) & roots(words(verses('col')))

Or to find all roots in Eph and Col

    roots(words(verses('eph') | verses('col')))

Interesting possibilities exist. This would find all root verbs in Eph

    roots(forms(pos('VERB'))) & roots(forms(words(verses('eph'))))

To find all verses in Mat that contain G4172

    verses('mat') & verses(words(forms('G4172')))

We may also consider abbreviated functions. So the previous search may look like

    V('mat') & V(W(F('G4172')))


Two significant changes to the temple
-------------------------------------

Compare Heb 10 and Eph 2. In one case, Paul is looking at the ripped veil and
the access for Isreal through it made possible by the flesh of Christ. In the
other, Paul is looking at the Middle Wall completely broken down and the access
to the Father for all Nations made possible through the flesh of Christ. A
physical change in the earthly temple reflects an important development in God's
plan in both cases.

Before the start of Acts: the veil is rent
    *   "By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through
        the veil, that is to say, his flesh" (Heb 10:20)
            A   The New Covenant (v16)
            B   Access to the Holiest (v19)
            C   High Priest over the House of God (v21)
    *   As a Gentile, this alone does not help me: I'm still stuck outside
        the wall! I can't even see the veil.
After the end of Acts: the middle wall is broken down
    *   "He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the
        middle wall of partition betwen us; having abolished in His flesh
        the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances"
        (Eph 2:14-15)
            A   Strangers from the covenants (v12)
            B   Access to the Father (v18)
            C   Of the household of God (v19)
    *   The distinction between Nations is gone. A new temple is being built.

Questions:
    * Does the earthly temple get rebuilt?
    * In Revelation, isn't the emphasis on the Heavenly Temple?
    * How do the holies in Eph differ from the holies in Heb?
