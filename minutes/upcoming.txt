Two actions on the temple frame the Acts period.

Before the start: the veil is rent
    *   "By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through
        the veil, that is to say, his flesh" (Heb 10:20)
    *   We see the New Covenant is in view (v16)
    *   Access to the Holiest is possible
    *   High Priest over the House of God (v21)
    *   As a Gentile, this alone does not help me: I'm still stuck outside
        the wall! I can't even see the veil.
After the end: the middle wall is broken down
    *   "He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the
        middle wall of partition betwen us; having abolished in His flesh
        the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances"
        (Eph 2:14-15)
    *   Strangers from the covenants (v12)
    *   Of the household of God
    *   Access to the Father
    *   A holy temple
    *   Now the distinction between Nations is gone!

The parallels between Eph 2 and Heb 10 are striking. In one case, Paul is
looking at the ripped veil and the access for Isreal through it made possible by
the flesh of Christ. In the other, Paul is looking at the Middle Wall completely
broken down and the access to the Father for all Nations made possible through
the flesh of Christ. A physical change in the earthly Temple reflects an
important change in God's plan in both cases.

Questions:
    * Does the earthly temple gets rebuilt?
    * In Revelation, isn't the emphasis on the Heavenly Temple?
