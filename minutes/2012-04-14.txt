Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   The Pentecostal Gifts were ultimately given to promote the Word (message)
    *   showed the authority of speakers
    *   helped get the message out
    *   1 Cor 13 - notice until something perfect
    *   Eph 4:13 - notice until something perfect
    *   Recall Eze 34:16: ultimate goal to feed the flock
*   What are the distinctive differences between apostles and prophets?
    A hypothesys:
    *   Prophet - with local believers mostly
    *   Apostle - a winder audience: non-believers too, bringing in new people
*   The Words on this page are Spirit:
    *   When we are filled with the Word we are filled with the Spirit
    *   Col 3:16 - no 'let' in the original
*   Hard to find good translations: a re-translation of Eph and Col done by
    someone who understands The Mystery would be nice
*   Links between glory and love (agape)
    *   John 17:24: Father's love and the glory of the Son
    *   Eph 5:25-27: Christ's love and the glorious church
    *   2 Pet 1:16-18: transfiguration
    *   What is the glory that the Father gave the Son? How is it related to
        inheritance and what we read about in Psalm 2? 

Action:
*   SJ/JB: Read Eph in ESV for next meeting
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
