Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Alternative to sketch: verbal introduction with photos and examples
    of current concepts of relevance (Jeff's photo of church billboard)
*   Paul's ministry during Acts was yet another mystery to provoke Israel
    (not necessarily evident from the parables)
*   Don't introduce horizontal and vertical picture separately:
    gradually reveal the entire picture together
*   Add vertical divisions around Mystery and temple in super heavenlies
    to diagram
*   Use photo illustration of the current temple
*   Have a quick skim through The Purpose-Driven Life 

Action:
*   SJ: Wrap up hidden purpose diagram and draft slides 
*   SJ: Finish initial query implementation of GNT search tool
*   SJ: Finish writing Relevance article
