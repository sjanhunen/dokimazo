Present: JB, SJ

Discussion:
*   Divorce in Luke 16: is it related to money? Note how Luke 16:18 seems to
    contradict what was permitted in the Law (i.e. Matt 9:8).
*   Paul's Prayer in Eph 1:18-21. The 'and' can be seen as amplifying the 'hope
    of his calling', even the 'glory of his inheritance', even the 'exceeding
    greatness of his power'.
*   Gentiles in Eph 3:6: these are all nations (ethnos) without distinction. We
    must be careful not to look at this through Acts-period glasses.
*   Israel on earth today: if they are in a "Lo-ammi" period, what does that
    really mean? Does God still see a distinction between them and other nations
    as far as the earth is concerned?

Action Items:
