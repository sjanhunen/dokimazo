The Puzzle
==========

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together? 500 pieces? 1000 pieces? 10,000 pieces?

How do you put together a large puzzle? You look at the picture on the box?

Sometimes if a piece doesn't fit, you have to put the entire puzzle together and just see the missing place where it fits.

I like to think of the Bible as a gigantic pizzle, where each verse forms a single piece. So it's kind of like a big jig-saw puzzle with 31,120 little pieces in total. The pieces are organized into smaller bags called books. There are 66 of these in the Old Testament, and NN of these in the New Testament.

What is the picture on the box of the Bible? Another way we might ask this question is: what is the unifying theme of the book? Let's take a quick look at the first and last books of the Bible to see if we can find any hints!

Introduce Adam and Christ as the pictures on the box. One is but a shadow of the other.

- Paul draws out significant parallels and contrasts between Adam and Christ
- Contrasts, death, and resurrection on 1 Cor 15
- The emphasis on "one man" in Rom 5

- Adam was created in the image of God in Genesis
- A temporary picture of something permament
- The earthly as a shadow of the heavenly (Col 2:17)
- Christ is the image of God in Revelation
- Linkage between the sacrifice in Genesis and the Lamb in Revelation
- The "lamb" in Genesis foreshadows the "Lamb" in Revelation
- The picture on the puzzle box

When we are studying the Bible and putting the pieces together, we should ask ourselves the question "what does this teach us about Christ?"

A few of the puzzle pieces that I've been thinking about recently are found at the end of Galations chapter 3:

	Gal 3:26-29.

If you read these verses in isolatoin, it really does sound like Paul is saying that anyone who has faith in Christ is considered a child of Abraham. But is this really what he is saying? 

Bring in the Jewish prayer Paul is answering here. Even if you are not physically related to Abraham, you can be a child of him in spirit.

To build out the picture on the box, we're going to look at three key words that help us understand God's purpose in Chirst: bride, husband, and body. This is the picture on the box and we can use the parallels between Adam and Christ to test out how things fit together.


The Bride
=========

The first question I want to ask is what does it mean to be "Abraham's seed"? 
To help answer this, let's turn to something that Christ said himself in John 9.

- Flesh vs Spirit
- Abraham's seed vs Abraham's seed

- There is no doubt that Abraham's seed wasn't just about a physical, family relationship with Abraham during the Acts period (Galations 3:27-29)
- Jesus makes a very clear distinction between these two levels of Abraham's seed in John 8 when he is speaking to the Jews
- Abraham's seed is about a purpose or calling that is based upon faith

- Abraham's seed, new Jerusalem, the Bride are somehow all related and all point to the permanent stuff rather than the temporary
- The parallels between old/earthly and new/heavenly that Paul cites in Galations

- In the OT (Old Covenant), the seed of Abraham was known as the wife. In the NT (New Covenant), the seed of Abraham is know as the bride. Note that the New Covenant is not yet fully realized.

- The physical difference and separation between Israel and the Nations was really meant to symbolize a bigger purpose taking place in Christ

During the Acts period, God was illustrating to the nation of Israel that Abraham's seed wasn't just about being physically related to Abraham. He was especially doing this through the ministry of the Apostle Paul.

Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Corinthians as a "bride": 2 Cor 11:2

	[2Co 11:2 NKJV] 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.

- Just as Eve was taken out of (separated from) Adam for a special purpose, the nation of Israel was taken out of all nations with a special purpose
- The Bride is an outcalling from Christ with a purpose
- The sand of the sea vs stars of the sky
- Abraham's seed in the spirit is about calling and purpose, not about fleshly relationships
- The promise to Eve about the seed parallels the promise to Abraham about seed

- The physical nation of Israel is an imperfect picture of the perfect bride that God is forming as part of the new creation. Being an Isralite does not automatically translate into being a part of the Bride.

The Husband 
===========

What's missing from the picture? Who does the bride ultimately get married to? A husband!

Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Ephesians as a husband:

	[Eph 4:13 NKJV] 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

The word for "husband" here is the same word Paul used in Corinthians when he was betrothing the "bride" to her husband. And every other time this word "man" appears in Ephesians, it is translated "husband". 

Verify this: We could translate this to say "into a perfect husband".

The church of the husband is defined by the calling of God, not by divisions in the flesh or by man-made distinctions.

The word for "husband" first appears in Eph 4. This word appears seven times throughout the book of Ephesians, but only in chapters 4 and 5. Eph 4 defines our calling as being the perfect husband. I believe Eph 4 is the first place in the book where it is clear that Paul is actually talking about the husband. 

What hints do we see in Eph that Paul is specifically speaking about a calling that is forming a husband:

- Eph 4:1,13 - walk worthy of your calling ... unto a perfect husband.
- Eph 4:15 - grow up into Him, the head, fitly joined together
- Eph 5:30 - we are members of His body, flesh, bones

The husband is a calling out of Christ with a purpose.

So a big secret revealed in Ephesians: the husband is actually formed out of a calling of believers with Christ as head.


The Body of Christ
==================

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:
- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a symbolic sense to refer to "Body of Christ"
- Paul plays a significant role in teaching on Mystery in scripture

The books that Paul teaches on the body of Christ:
- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- Hebrews?

Books of Paul that discuss mystery:
- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- 1 Timothy
- 2 Thessalonians

- When Paul is teaching about the bride or virgin (2 Cor 11:2), he clearly refers to those believers as part of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:13)
- Paul also clearly refers to the husband as the body of Christ in Eph.
- Isn't it fair to say that both the husband and the bride are bodies of Christ. This word is used very specifically in both cases.
- It's almost as if the body of Christ is a joined-together body

- Could it be, that the new anthropos spoken of in Ephesians is actually this joined-together body of husband and bride? They are distinct bodies and different callings, but I do believe that God will ultimately in His time, bring His purposes together in Christ.
- Does it not make sense that anthropos includes both the male and the female aspect.
- A new person is formed when husband and bride are brought together.
- When Christ is all in all, can there be any distinction between male or female, Jew or Greek, bond or free. Don't Gal 3:28 and Col 3:11 both find fulfillment here in the new anthropos?
- The Christ (the last Adam) and the old anthropos contrasted in 1 Cor 15:47
- What books in the Bible specifically speak of the "new anthropos"?
- As part of our walk, we are instructed to reflect that we are a part of this new person (Eph 4:22-24)

Ephesians 1-3 is specifically revealing the new person (anthropos) that brings together the purposes of God:

- Eph 1:10: God's plan to unite all things in Him
- Eph 2:14: made both one - God is making one flesh out of two in Christ through the spirit, much like he did with Adam and Eve in the flesh. When these two are combined, it's not one tacked onto the other, but the two together creating something entirely new. In other words, the new anthropos.
- Is "both" in Eph 2 referring primarily to people according to the flesh or to purposes according to calling? Does the difference between Israel and Nations disappear in the restored earth?
- Eph 2:15 shows that God is making one new person (anthropos) in Christ.
- Eph 3:15: of whom every family is named in heaven and earth
- Eph 2:16: what does the "one body" include? The new anthropos? It's possible that body could refer to the husband, to the bride, or to the resulting combination of the two.
- Eph 3:6: The word syssomos only appears in Eph 3:6. What God is creating here is a joint-body, where both have access to the Father by the same spirit. This is a very significant piece of the puzzle. Is the joint body in Ephesians speaking about only the husband, or is the join body actually something new that God creates when he joins the husband and bride in His ultimate purpose of the ages?
- Eph 2:19 - together citizens (only in Ephesians)
- What other joint / together words do we find in Ephesians???
- Look back at Genesis 1:26. Is mankind in this verse anthropos? (see ""One Flesh"--Eph. 5.22-24, 5.31: Marriage and the New Creation")

We find the creation of the new person in Ephesians, much like we find the creation of the old person in Genesis. The word "anthropos" appears 9x throughout Ephesians.

Both Gal and Eph can take full force when we realize both of these callings can only be realized in the person of Christ. They are related, but they are different roles with different purposes.

Could it be that Eph 1-3 has the theme of the creation of the new person in Christ that is the culmination of God's purpose. Eph 4-6 is specifically outlining our calling as the husband within that new person.

- The great or greatest mystery in Eph 5 takes us back to Genesis. How many other times is this passage quoted in scripture? Why is this significant? Is leaving father and mother and becoming one flesh kind of like what happens in Christ to those that are called?

- We need to very carefully evaluate what the new person in Ephesians refers to. I believe it makes a lot of sense that this includes more than just a husband.

The Picture
===========

- Consider a recap of purpose of God visually. Start with Adam/Eve and extend to nations. Then extend to heavenly callings in Christ. End with new anthropos.

- The first anthropos and all that flows out of him are but a picture of the last Adam, the new anthropos
- Adam was the name for both Adam/Eve together at one point before the fall.
- This earthly picture is marred and distorted, but through God's plan of redemption, this picture is being corrected and will one day be put right
- Our lives are a chance to foreshadow the new anthropos. Our walk will determine how well we reflect this future reality in our present lives.
- Paul suggests that our marriage relationships today can reflect the relationship between Christ as the head (husband) and the body of the husband (wife).


Possibility: close with the question of what is the new anthropos.
