The Puzzle
==========

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together? 500 pieces? 1000 pieces? 10,000 pieces?

I like to think of the Bible as a gigantic pizzle, where each verse forms a single piece. So it's kind of like a big jig-saw puzzle with 31,120 little pieces in total. The pieces are organized into smaller bags called books. There are 66 of these in the Old Testament, and NN of these in the New Testament.

How do you put together a large puzzle? You look at the picture on the box? Sometimes if a piece doesn't fit, you have to put the entire puzzle together and just see the missing place where it fits.

What is the picture on the box of the Bible? Another way we might ask this question is: what is the unifying theme of the book? Let's take a quick look at the first and last books of the Bible to see if we can find any hints!

For the crowd here today, we are going to be looking at some pretty familar pieces. But I would like to test out wheter some of these pieces perhaps fit togheter better maybe just a little differently than you might have considered before.

A few of the puzzle pieces that I've been thinking about recently are found at the end of Galations chapter 3 and then in Eph 2:

	[Gal 3:26-29 NKJV] 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you [are] Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

	[Eph 2:11-14 KJV] 11 Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];


If we look at just these few verses together, doesn't it really look like they are talking about exactly the same thing?

It really does sound like Paul is saying that anyone who has faith in Christ is considered a child of Abraham. But is this really what he is saying? 

The Bride
=========

The first thing to notice about these verses in Gal 3 is that the major theme is Christ. In just these four verses, we read the phrases

- "in Christ Jesus"
- "into Christ"
- "put on Christ"
- "one in Christ Jesus"

Paul then concludes with "if you are Christ's" you are "Abraham's seed". Being a child of Abraham here has more to do with faith in Christ than it does with being physically related to Abraham. And here in Christ, the outward physical  distinctions that we may see do not create advantages or divisions. This is illustrated in a unique way in v28 that would be easy to miss.

Paul, being a good Jew would very well know about a series of twelve blessings that would be recited each morning by a faithful Jewish man (is there a name for this?) Three of these go like this:

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a Gentile."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a slave."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a woman."

When we look at these statements through our western 21st century lens, they come across as potentially racist and sexist. But I don't believe that is the intent behind this series of blessings. Rather than these statements being about a Jewish man gloating in his superiority (which they may have been for some), I think these statements are about a Jewish man acknowledging the high bar of responsibility given to him in the Torah or the law of Moses.


Under the law, there were 613 commandments in total. If you were a free Jewish man, all of these commandments would apply to you. In other words, the full burden of the law was on your shoulders. If you were born a Jewish woman, God acknowledged the differences in roles between men and women, so fewer commandments applied. Even fewer for slaves. None for Gentiles, unless you became circumcised.

The Promise came first and faith came first with Abraham. If you want to be blessed under the old covenant with that seed of Abraham, you have to keep the law. If you want to be blessed with Abraham under the new covenant, faith is your only ticket. Both of these blessings are associated with the covenants and with Abraham.

Blessings / curses of the law.

[Deu 26:18-19 KJV] 18 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that [thou] shouldest keep all his commandments; 19 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

I can see the Jewish mind thinking that more commandments => more blessing. But what can we really say about the blessing of the law. It can at its best delay your death.

Put down props for two "Children of Abraham"

In this section, simply put down the two "Children of Abraham" props. Discussion stops with the two covenants.

But when Paul is talking about the seed or children of Abraham, he isn't talking about the Old Covenant or the law. Because to be a part of that required circumcision to become a proselite. He isn't talking about some kind of "Child of Abraham".

Bring out the second "Child of Abraham" prop. Question: is there any hint in the scripture that Abraham might have two lines of descendants like this?

- The sand of the sea vs stars of the sky. Earthly Jerusalem vs Heavenly Jerusalem.

Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Corinthians as a "bride": 2 Cor 11:2

	[2Co 11:2 NKJV] 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.

The Corinthian church, much like the Galation church, had a mix of Jews and Gentiles.

What Paul is really saying is when it comes to these children of Abraham he is discussion, it's not about the flesh or specific blood lines and any advantages or disadvantages that may come by that. It is about the Spirit, and it is received through faith. The promise and the blessings are the spirit poured out to do the work of God.

Under the Old Covenant, one had to become a proselite to be blessed with Israel. But under the New Covenant, one required faith to be blessed with Abraham.

- It's not about the Old Covenant, it's about the New Covenant.
- Abraham's seed is about a purpose or calling that is based upon faith
- Abraham's seed, new Jerusalem, the Bride are all related and all point to the permanent stuff rather than the temporary
- Review quickly all the parallels that Paul cites in Galations.

Mention briefly how Christ himself discusses children of Abraham vs children of Abraham too in John 8.

- The earthly children represent the wife of the Old Covenant. The heavenly children represent the bride of the New Covenant.

- In the OT (Old Covenant), the seed of Abraham was known as the wife. In the NT (New Covenant), the seed of Abraham is know as the bride. Note that the New Covenant is not yet fully realized.

- The physical nation of Israel is an imperfect picture of the perfect bride that God is forming as part of the new creation. Being an Isralite does not automatically translate into being a part of the Bride.

During the Acts period, God was illustrating to the nation of Israel that Abraham's seed wasn't just about being physically related to Abraham. He was especially doing this through the ministry of the Apostle Paul.

[Jhn 3:12 KJV] 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?

- "God is able of these stones to raise up Children unto Abraham" (Luke 3:8)

Future Study: Is Phil 3 restating some of the same things that Paul says in Gal 3? This would be a good study and worth a close look. 

The Husband 
===========

When we look at this picture as someone who is not a Jew, not part of these covenants, it looks like there are two ways to be blessed: blessed with Israel according to the flesh, and blessed with Abraham by faith.

But is this the whole picture? What could be missing from this picture?

To answer this, we need to go right back to Adam to understand how and why Israel was created in the first place. In Genesis, God started by creating Adam first. How was Eve created? She was taken out of Adam. Put down Eve prop. Why was Eve created? To help Adam. There was no help found for him at that point.

Explan how Adam symbolizes all people and nations. Then introduce the "All Nations" prop. How was Israel created? A single nation was separated out of all the other nations through someone called Abraham. Put down the "Children of Abraham" prop. Why was Israel created? To be a blessing to all the other nations and to serve God. And I think that Israel will actually be a helper for all the other nations some day, but not until this serving God part is actualy figured out. [Bring in suitable quotes from Genesis here]. Need to be strategic about placing props on one vs two (separate chairs).


Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Ephesians as a husband:

	[Eph 4:13 NKJV] 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

The word for "husband" here is the same word Paul used in Corinthians when he was betrothing the "bride" to her husband. And every other time this word "man" appears in Ephesians, it is translated "husband". 

Verify this: We could translate this to say "into a perfect husband".

The church of the husband is defined by the calling of God, not by divisions in the flesh or by man-made distinctions.

The word for "husband" first appears in Eph 4. This word appears seven times throughout the book of Ephesians, but only in chapters 4 and 5. Eph 4 defines our calling as being the perfect husband. I believe Eph 4 is the first place in the book where it is clear that Paul is actually talking about the husband. 

What hints do we see in Eph that Paul is specifically speaking about a calling that is forming a husband:

- Eph 4:1,13 - walk worthy of your calling ... unto a perfect husband.
- Eph 4:15 - grow up into Him, the head, fitly joined together
- Eph 5:30 - we are members of His body, flesh, bones

The husband is a calling out of Christ with a purpose.

So a big secret revealed in Ephesians: the husband is actually formed out of a calling of believers with Christ as head.

Something to consider in a recap:
- Blessed through the Children of Abraham
- Blessed with the Children of Abraham
- Blessed apart from the Children of Abraham


The Body of Christ
==================

A few more puzzle pieces:

	[1Co 12:4, 7, 12-13 KJV] 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. ... 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ... 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ. 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

	[Eph 4:7, 11-12 KJV] 7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ... 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
	[Eph 5:30 KJV] 30 For we are members of his body,[G4983] of his flesh, and of his bones.


Spiritual gifts are clearly mentioned in both 1 Cor 12 and Eph 4. The body of Christ is also clearly mentioned.

If these were the only verses in the Bible, we would have to conclude they are talking about the same thing. 

Both Jews and Gentiles according to the flesh are part of the husband and the bride. But the husband and the bride are very different.

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:
- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a symbolic sense to refer to "Body of Christ"
- Paul plays a significant role in teaching on Mystery in scripture

The books that Paul teaches on the body of Christ:
- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- Hebrews?

Books of Paul that discuss mystery:
- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- 1 Timothy
- 2 Thessalonians

- When Paul is teaching about the bride or virgin (2 Cor 11:2), he clearly refers to those believers as part of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:13)
- Paul also clearly refers to the husband as the body of Christ in Eph.
- Isn't it fair to say that both the husband and the bride are bodies of Christ. This word is used very specifically in both cases.
- It's almost as if the body of Christ is a joined-together body

The virgin in 2 Cor is espoused, but the wedding hasn't happened yet. According to this source, being espoused is just as legally binding under Jewish law as the marriage ceremony:

http://www.ndtime.net/jewish_wedding_traditions_marriage_customs_espoused_wife.htm

Both Gal and Eph can take full force when we realize both of these callings can only be realized in the person of Christ. They are related, but they are different roles with different purposes and different bodies.

Think about the significance of the fact that the Bride hasn't been formed yet. Adam existed for some time before Eve was taken out of Him. It is the same with Christ and His body. There are two distinct purposes that are formed out of Christ: the husband and the bride.

In Eph we read we are members of his body, and flesh, and bones. 

Was not Eve taken out of Adam her husband? How is the bride formed?

[Gal 4:19 KJV] 19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,

- The great or greatest mystery in Eph 5 takes us back to Genesis. How many other times is this passage quoted in scripture? Why is this significant? Is leaving father and mother and becoming one flesh kind of like what happens in Christ to those that are called?

- We need to very carefully evaluate what the new person in Ephesians refers to. I believe it makes a lot of sense that this includes more than just a husband.

- When I read some of the verses in Eph 1-3, I begin to think it's possible they they don't just refer to the husband alone, but that they may refer to the bringing together of both of these callings one day in Christ.

- Bring out the point that the picture on the box is Christ and the new person that is being formed in him.
- Adam and Eve, the Nations and Israel are really shadows of this ultimate reality.

- Adam was created in the image of God in Genesis
- A temporary picture of something permament
- The earthly as a shadow of the heavenly (Col 2:17)
- Christ is the image of God in Revelation

- This earthly picture is marred and distorted, but through God's plan of redemption, this picture is being corrected and will one day be put right

- Adam was the name for both Adam/Eve together at one point before the fall. Perhaps that is a foreshadow of some future ages in God's plan.
