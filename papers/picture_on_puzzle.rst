The Picture on the Box
======================

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together? 500 pieces? 1000 pieces? 10,000 pieces?

How do you put together a large puzzle? You look at the picture on the box?

I like to think of the Bible as a gigantic pizzle, where each verse forms a single piece. So it's kind of like a big jig-saw puzzle with 31,120 little pieces in total. The pieces are organized into smaller bags called books. There are 66 of these in the Old Testament, and NN of these in the New Testament.

What is the picture on the box of the Bible? Another way we might ask this question is: what is the unifying theme of the book? Let's take a quick look at the first and last books of the Bible to see if we can find any hints!

Consider bringing in the question of Abraham's seed as a good example of a single puzzle piece that is very hard to ever understand without looking at the picture on the box.

Adam and Christ
===============

- Adam was created in the image of God in Genesis
	- A temporary picture of something permament
- Christ is the image of God in Revelation
	- Linkage between the sacrifice in Genesis and the Lamb in Revelation
	- The picture on the puzzle box
	- When we are studying the Bible, we should ask what does this teach us about Christ?

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:
- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a symbolic sense to refer to "Body of Christ"
- Paul plays a significant role in teaching on Mystery in scripture

- Paul draws out significant parallels and contrasts between Adam and Christ
- Contrasts, death, and resurrection on 1 Cor 15
- The emphasis on "one man" in Rom 5

Israel and the Bride (a.k.a Abraham's Seed)
===========================================

- The temporary picture of Adam and Eve is full of lessons about lasting things in Christ.
- Just as Eve was taken out of Adam for a special purpose, the nation of Israel was taken out of all nations with a special purpose
- The physical nation of Israel is an imperfect picture of the perfect bride that God is forming as part of the new creation. Being an Isralite does not automatically translate into being a part of the Bride.

- There is no doubt that Abraham's seed wasn't just about a physical, family relationship with Abraham during the Acts period (Galations 3:27-29)
- Jesus makes a very clear distinction between these two levels of Abraham's seed in John 8 when he is speaking to the Jews
- Abraham's seed is about a purpose or calling that is based upon faith
- When Paul is teaching about the bride or virgin (2 Cor 11:2), he clearly refers to those believers as part of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:13)

- Abraham's seed, new Jerusalem, the Bride are somehow all related and all point to the permanent stuff rather than the temporary
- The sand of the sea vs stars of the sky

- The physical difference and separation between Israel and the Nations was really meant to symbolize a bigger purpose taking place in Christ
