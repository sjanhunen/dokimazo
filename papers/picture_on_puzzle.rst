The Puzzle
==========

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together? 500 pieces? 1000 pieces? 10,000 pieces?

I like to think of studying the Bible as something like working on a gigantic pizzle. A really big puzzle with 31,120 little pieces in total. That's one piece for each verse. The pieces are organized into smaller bags called books. There are 66 of these in the Old Testament, and NN of these in the New Testament.

How do you put together a large puzzle? You look at the picture on the box. Sometimes if a piece doesn't fit, you have to put the entire puzzle together and just see the missing place where it fits. Having some concept of the picture on the box helps greatly 

For the crowd here today, we are going to be looking at some pretty familar pieces. But I would like to test out wheter some of these pieces perhaps fit togheter better maybe just a little differently than you might have considered before.

Today I brought a few of the puzzle pieces that I've been thinking about recently. In fact, I have been thinking about these for quite a long time and I still find them to be a challenging set of verses to understand:

	[1Co 12:4, 7, 12-13 KJV] 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. ... 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ... 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ. 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

	[Eph 4:7, 11-12 KJV] 7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ... 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
	[Eph 5:30 KJV] 30 For we are members of his body,[G4983] of his flesh, and of his bones.

These passages are both written by the Apostle Paul. They are both written to churches that had believing Gentiles (in other words, these passages were definitely not written just to believing Jews). Paul mentions gifts in both passages. And most importantly, Paul refers to the "body of Christ in each passage."

To the Corinthians, Paul says:

	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

And to the Epheians, Paul says: 

	for the edifying of the body of Christ:
	[Eph 5:30 KJV] 30 For we are members of his body,[G4983] of his flesh, and of his bones.

If we look at just these few verses together, doesn't it really look like they are talking about exactly the same thing? In fact, if these were the only pieces we had to work with, we would probably conclude they are talking about exactly the same thing. 

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:

- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a figurative sense to refer to "Body of Christ"
- We are concerned with the figurative use of body of Christ to refer to a group of called out believers in Christ. There is a word for "called out" in the Greek and it's the word translated "church" in our english. So "body of Christ" is a figurative reference to "church".
- Paul plays a significant role in teaching on Mystery in scripture

The books that Paul teaches on the body of Christ:

- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- Hebrews?

Books of Paul that discuss mystery:

- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- 1 Timothy
- 2 Thessalonians

The mysteries that were revealed do seem to be related to the body of Christ. I believe Paul is an apostle that was given special insight into the body of Christ through the mysteries that were revealed to him. I also believe these insights are critical in helping us fit together the puzzle pieces in the Bible.

The Bride
=========

.. sidebar:: Key Points

	- "Abraham's seed" is used both literally and figuratively in Scripture
	- The literal seed stands for the wife of the Old Covenant and enjoys the physical blessings of the law
	- The figurative seed stands for the bride of the New Covenant and enjoys the spiritual blessings of the promise to Abraham
	- A Gentile could be blessed under the Law only by becoming a proselyte and being circumcised
	- A Gentile could be blessed with Abraham through faith
	- The blessings of the law could only delay death, only the blessing of faith could give life
	
There is an important phrase used in Scripture that will help shed some light on the body of Christ. This phrase appears translated a few different ways as "child of Abraham", "Abraham's descendant", or "Abraham's seed" depending on the translation and the exact Greek word used in the original.

Christ himeself uses this phrase in John 8 in a discussion with the Jews. Both of them are using this phrase, but they mean something very different:

	[Jhn 8:31-39 NKJV] 31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, "If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32 "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." 33 They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How [can] You say, 'You will be made free'?" 34 Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. 35 "And a slave does not abide in the house forever, [but] a son abides forever. 36 "Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed. 37 "I know that you are Abraham's descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. 38 "I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father." 39 They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.

.. note::

	Set up the two "Children of Abraham" props on the separate chairs. Illustrate the following section by pointing at the relevant prop during discussion.

Christ is acknowledging that these Jews were in fact related to Abraham physically ("Abraham's descendants"). But a physical relationship wasn't enough for them to be considered "Abraham's children." What, then, makes someone a "child of Abraham" in this sense?

Paul talks significantly about the children of Abraham throughout the book of Galations. And then, in Galations chapter 3, Pauls says this:

	[Gal 3:26-29 NKJV] 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you [are] Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

The first thing to notice about these verses in Gal 3 is that the major theme is Christ. In just these four verses, we read the phrases

- "in Christ Jesus"
- "into Christ"
- "put on Christ"
- "one in Christ Jesus"

Paul then concludes with "if you are Christ's" you are "Abraham's seed". Being a true child of Abraham here has more to do with faith in Christ than it does with being physically related to Abraham. And here in Christ, the outward physical distinctions that we may see do not create and disadvantages or divisions.

Paul, being a good Jew would very well know about a series of twelve blessings that would be recited each morning by a faithful Jewish man (is there a name for this?) Three of these go like this:

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a Gentile."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a slave."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a woman."

When we look at these statements through our western 21st century lens, they come across as potentially racist and sexist. But I don't believe that is the intent behind this series of blessings. Rather than these statements being about a Jewish man gloating in his superiority (which they may have been for some), I think these statements are really about a Jewish man acknowledging the blessings that were a part of the law of Moses.

Under the law, there were 613 commandments in total. If you were a free Jewish man, all of these commandments would apply to you. In other words, the full burden of the law was on your shoulders. If you were born a Jewish woman, God acknowledged the differences in roles between men and women, so fewer commandments applied. Even fewer for slaves. None for Gentiles, unless you became circumcised. I can see the Jewish mind thinking that more commandments implies more blessing. In other words, if you had more commandments to keep, you had the opportunity to get more blessing.

What Paul is talking about in Galations 3 is the Gentiles
The blessings of Abraham are related to the promises made to Abraham. 

	[Gal 3:14 KJV] 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

And the blessing of Abraham is something different and far better than any of the physical blessings the law could give. In 2 Corinthians, Paul says that "the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life". He refers to the law as the ministration of condemnation and death. The law can at its best delay your death. And at its worse it can accelerate your death. If you kept all 613 commandments perfectly, the result would be a long and prosperous natural life. But the law itself could never actually give you life.

	[2Co 3:6-9 KJV] 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 7 But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away: 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 9 For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

True eternal life could only come through the Spirit. And the gifts of the spirit were like a foretaste of something to come.

This may be a good place to illustrate some of the contrasts Paul highlights in Gal.

Finally, Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Corinthians as a "bride": 2 Cor 11:2

	[2Co 11:2 NKJV] 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.

As an able minister of the new covenant, Paul's goal is to present these believers (which include both Jews and Gentiles), as a "bride" prepared for her husband. 

.. note::

	Turn around Bride prop to reveal title. 

What Paul is really saying is when it comes to these children of Abraham he is discussion, it's not about the flesh or specific blood lines and any advantages or disadvantages that may come by that. It is about the Spirit, and it is received through faith. The promise and the blessings are the spirit poured out to do the work of God.

.. note::

	Bring in the all nations prop to discuss how outsiders could participate in blessings. 

If you want to be blessed under the old covenant with that seed of Abraham, you have to keep the law. But when Paul is talking about the seed or children of Abraham, he isn't talking about the Old Covenant or the law. Because to be a part of that required circumcision to become a proselite. He isn't talking about that kind of "Child of Abraham". If you want to be blessed with Abraham under the new covenant, faith is your only ticket. Under the Old Covenant, one had to become a proselite to be blessed with Israel. But under the New Covenant, one required faith to be blessed with Abraham.

The Corinthian church, much like the Galation church, had a mix of Jews and Gentiles. And the gifts of the spirit were poured out on both, quite irrespectively of whether they were physically circumcised or not. To partake in the blessings of the Bride (the children of Abraham), it wasn't enough to be a descendant of Abraham. Faith was required. God allowed the outsiders (the Gentiles) to partake in these blessings of Abraham (without being circumcised) to help illustrate this point.

The Husband 
===========

.. sidebar:: Key Points

	- If the only pieces we had available were about the children of Abraham, were would we look for blessing
	- But The bride is only half of the picture we are trying to understand
	- Paul speaks very specifically about a calling that is forming the perfect husband
	- Ephesians specifically speaks of Blessings that we get to enjoy, but these are not the blessings of Abraham, these are the Blessings of Christ Himself

We're looking at this picture as someone who is not a Jew, not part of these covenants, it looks like there are two ways to be blessed: blessed with Israel according to the flesh, and blessed with Abraham by faith.

But is this the whole picture? What could be missing from this picture?

To answer this, we need to go right back to Adam to understand how and why Israel was created in the first place. In Genesis, God started by creating Adam first. How was Eve created? She was taken out of Adam. Put down Eve prop. Why was Eve created? To help Adam. There was no help found for him at that point. Together, they formed the first couple.

Explan how Adam symbolizes all people and nations. How was Israel created? A single nation was separated out of all the other nations through someone called Abraham.  Why was Israel created? To be a blessing to all the other nations and to serve God. And I think that Israel will actually be a helper for all the other nations some day, but not until this serving God part is actualy figured out. [Bring in suitable quotes from Genesis here]. Need to be strategic about placing props on one vs two (separate chairs).

Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Ephesians as a husband:

	[Eph 4:13 NKJV] 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

The word for "husband" here is the same word Paul used in Corinthians when he was betrothing the "bride" to her husband. And every other time this word "man" appears in Ephesians, it is translated "husband". 

Verify this: We could translate this to say "into a perfect husband".

The church of the husband is defined by the calling of God, not by divisions in the flesh or by man-made distinctions.

The word for "husband" first appears in Eph 4. This word appears seven times throughout the book of Ephesians, but only in chapters 4 and 5. Eph 4 defines our calling as being the perfect husband. I believe Eph 4 is the first place in the book where it is clear that Paul is actually talking about the husband. 

What hints do we see in Eph that Paul is specifically speaking about a calling that is forming a husband:

- Eph 4:1,13 - walk worthy of your calling ... unto a perfect husband.
- Eph 4:15 - grow up into Him, the head, fitly joined together
- Eph 5:30 - we are members of His body, flesh, bones

The husband is a calling out of Christ with a purpose.

So a big secret revealed in Ephesians: the husband is actually formed out of a calling of believers with Christ as head.

The blessing and the promise in Eph 1 is different than the blessing and promise given to Abraham.


Something to consider in a recap:
- Blessed through the Children of Abraham
- Blessed with the Children of Abraham
- Blessed apart from the Children of Abraham


The Body of Christ
==================


Both Jews and Gentiles according to the flesh are part of the husband and the bride. But the husband and the bride are very different.


- When Paul is teaching about the bride or virgin (2 Cor 11:2), he clearly refers to those believers as part of the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:13)
- Paul also clearly refers to the husband as the body of Christ in Eph.
- Isn't it fair to say that both the husband and the bride are bodies of Christ. This word is used very specifically in both cases.
- It's almost as if the body of Christ is a joined-together body

The virgin in 2 Cor is espoused, but the wedding hasn't happened yet. According to this source, being espoused is just as legally binding under Jewish law as the marriage ceremony:

http://www.ndtime.net/jewish_wedding_traditions_marriage_customs_espoused_wife.htm

So, the espoused bride was legally treated as if she was married to her husband. There were really just some formalities that had to take place later.

Both Gal and Eph can take full force when we realize both of these callings can only be realized in the person of Christ. They are related, but they are different roles with different purposes and different bodies.

Think about the significance of the fact that the Bride hasn't been formed yet. Adam existed for some time before Eve was taken out of Him. It is the same with Christ and His body. There are two distinct purposes that are formed out of Christ: the husband and the bride.

In Eph we read we are members of his body, and flesh, and bones. 

Was not Eve taken out of Adam her husband? How is the bride formed?

[Gal 4:19 KJV] 19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,

- The great or greatest mystery in Eph 5 takes us back to Genesis. How many other times is this passage quoted in scripture? Why is this significant? Is leaving father and mother and becoming one flesh kind of like what happens in Christ to those that are called?

- We need to very carefully evaluate what the new person in Ephesians refers to. I believe it makes a lot of sense that this includes more than just a husband.

- When I read some of the verses in Eph 1-3, I begin to think it's possible they they don't just refer to the husband alone, but that they may refer to the bringing together of both of these callings one day in Christ.

- Eve was taken out of Adam when he slept. This could very well be a symbol of death and resurrection. After the resurrection, God brought the bride to Adam.

- Bring out the point that the picture on the box is Christ and the new person that is being formed in him.
- Adam and Eve, the Nations and Israel are really shadows of this ultimate reality.

- Adam was created in the image of God in Genesis
- A temporary picture of something permament
- The earthly as a shadow of the heavenly (Col 2:17)
- Christ is the image of God in Revelation

- This earthly picture is marred and distorted, but through God's plan of redemption, this picture is being corrected and will one day be put right

- Adam was the name for both Adam/Eve together at one point before the fall. Perhaps that is a foreshadow of some future ages in God's plan.
