The Puzzle
==========

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together? 500 pieces? 1000 pieces? 10,000 pieces?

I like to think of reading and studying the Bible as working on a big pizzle. A really big puzzle that has one piece for each verse. That's 31,120 pieces in total. When you're dealing with something this big, how do you fit the pieces together and know that they are in the right place? Based on my personal experience putting together puzzles, this is very difficult without some type of picture to look at. In other words, what is the puzzle. Sometimes if a piece doesn't fit, you have to put the entire puzzle together and just see the missing place where it fits. Having some concept of the picture on the box helps greatly 

Haven't had a picture on my Bible since I had a picture Bible as a kid. Maybe look at some picture Bible examples. Who is the Bible about? The Bible is about a person. Looking at the first book, the first person we encounter is Adam. Looking at the last book Revelation, the last person we encounter

	Bring out puzzle prop with a few pieces for illustration.

Today I brought a few of the puzzle pieces that I've been thinking about recently. In fact, I have been thinking about these for quite a long time and I still find them to be a challenging set of verses to understand. For the crowd here today, we are going to be looking at some pretty familar pieces.

	[1Co 12:4, 7, 12-13 KJV] 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. ... 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ... 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ. 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

	[Eph 4:7, 11-12 KJV] 7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ... 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

These passages are both written by the Apostle Paul. They are both written to churches that had believing Gentiles (in other words, these passages were definitely not written just to believing Jews). Paul mentions gifts in both passages. And most importantly, Paul refers to the "body of Christ in each passage."

To the Corinthians, Paul says:

	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

And to the Epheians, Paul says: 

	for the edifying of the body of Christ:
	[Eph 5:30 KJV] 30 For we are members of his body,[G4983] of his flesh, and of his bones.

If we look at just these few verses together, doesn't it really look like they are talking about exactly the same thing? In fact, if these were the only pieces we had to work with, we would probably conclude they are talking about exactly the same thing. 

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:

- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a figurative sense to refer to "Body of Christ"
- We are concerned with the figurative use of body of Christ to refer to a group of called out believers in Christ. There is a word for "called out" in the Greek and it's the word translated "church" in our english. So "body of Christ" is a figurative reference to "church".
- Paul plays a significant role in teaching on Mystery in scripture

The books that Paul teaches on the body of Christ:

- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- Hebrews?

Books of Paul that discuss mystery:

- Romans
- 1 Corinthians
- Ephesians
- Colossians
- 1 Timothy
- 2 Thessalonians

The mysteries that were revealed do seem to be related to the body of Christ. I believe Paul is an apostle that was given special insight into the body of Christ through the mysteries that were revealed to him. I also believe these insights are critical in helping us fit together the puzzle pieces in the Bible.

The Bride
=========

.. sidebar:: Key Points

	- "Abraham's seed" is used both literally and figuratively in Scripture
	- The literal seed stands for the wife of the Old Covenant and enjoys the physical blessings of the law
	- The figurative seed stands for the bride of the New Covenant and enjoys the spiritual blessings of the promise to Abraham
	- A Gentile could be blessed under the Law only by becoming a proselyte and being circumcised
	- A Gentile could be blessed with Abraham through faith
	- The blessings of the law could only delay death, only the blessing of faith could give life
	
There is an important phrase used in Scripture that will help shed some light on the body of Christ. This phrase appears translated a few different ways as "child of Abraham", "Abraham's descendant", or "Abraham's seed" depending on the translation and the exact Greek word used in the original.

Christ himeself uses this phrase in John 8 in a discussion with the Jews. Both of them are using this phrase, but they mean something very different:

	[Jhn 8:31-39 NKJV] 31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, "If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32 "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." 33 They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How [can] You say, 'You will be made free'?" 34 Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. 35 "And a slave does not abide in the house forever, [but] a son abides forever. 36 "Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed. 37 "I know that you are Abraham's descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. 38 "I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father." 39 They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.

.. note::

	Set up the two "Children of Abraham" props on the separate chairs. Illustrate the following section by pointing at the relevant prop during discussion.

Christ is acknowledging that these Jews were in fact related to Abraham physically ("Abraham's descendants"). But a physical relationship wasn't enough for them to be considered "Abraham's children." What, then, makes someone a "child of Abraham" in this sense?

Paul talks significantly about the children of Abraham throughout the book of Galations. And then, in Galations chapter 3, Pauls says this:

	[Gal 3:26-29 NKJV] 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you [are] Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

The first thing to notice about these verses in Gal 3 is that the major theme is Christ. In just these four verses, we read the phrases

- "in Christ Jesus"
- "into Christ"
- "put on Christ"
- "one in Christ Jesus"

Paul then concludes with "if you are Christ's" you are "Abraham's seed". Being a true child of Abraham here has more to do with faith in Christ than it does with being physically related to Abraham. And here in Christ, the outward physical distinctions that we may see do not create and disadvantages or divisions.

Paul, being a good Jew would very well know about a series of twelve blessings that would be recited each morning by a faithful Jewish man (is there a name for this?) Three of these go like this:

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a Gentile."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a slave."

	"Blessed are you, Hashem, King of the Universe, for not having made me a woman."

When we look at these statements through our western 21st century lens, they come across as potentially racist and sexist. But I don't believe that is the intent behind this series of blessings. Rather than these statements being about a Jewish man gloating in his superiority (which they may have been for some), I think these statements are really about a Jewish man acknowledging the blessings that were a part of the law of Moses.

Under the law, there were 613 commandments in total. If you were a free Jewish man, all of these commandments would apply to you. In other words, the full burden of the law was on your shoulders. If you were born a Jewish woman, God acknowledged through the law the differences in roles between men and women, so fewer commandments applied. Even fewer for slaves. None for Gentiles, unless you became circumcised.

Why would a Jewish man be thanking God for a greater burden under the law. I can see the Jewish mind thinking that more commandments implies more blessing. In other words, if you had more commandments to keep, you had the opportunity to get more blessing. Reference a quote from the law.

When Paul speaks of being a descendant of Abraham, he has blessings in view:

	[Gal 3:14 KJV] 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

And the blessing of Abraham is something different and far better than any of the physical blessings the law could give. In 2 Corinthians, Paul says that "the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life". He refers to the law as the ministration of condemnation and death. The law can at its best delay your death. And at its worse it can accelerate your death. If you kept all 613 commandments perfectly, the result would be a long and prosperous natural life. But the law itself could never actually give you life.

	[2Co 3:6-9 KJV] 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 7 But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away: 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 9 For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

True eternal life could only come through the Spirit. And the gifts of the spirit were like a foretaste of something to come.

This may be a good place to illustrate some of the contrasts Paul highlights in Gal.

Finally, Paul specifically calls out those he is ministering to in Corinthians as a "bride": 2 Cor 11:2

	[2Co 11:2 NKJV] 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.

As an able minister of the new covenant, Paul's goal is to present these believers (which include both Jews and Gentiles), as a "bride" prepared for her husband. 

.. note::

	Turn around Bride prop to reveal title. 

What Paul is really saying is when it comes to these children of Abraham he is discussion, it's not about the flesh or specific blood lines and any advantages or disadvantages that may come by that. It is about the Spirit, and it is received through faith. The promise and the blessings are the spirit poured out to do the work of God.

.. note::

	Bring in the all nations prop to discuss how outsiders could participate in blessings. 

If you want to be blessed under the old covenant with that seed of Abraham, you have to keep the law. But when Paul is talking about the seed or children of Abraham, he isn't talking about the Old Covenant or the law. Because to be a part of that required circumcision to become a proselite. He isn't talking about that kind of "Child of Abraham". If you want to be blessed with Abraham under the new covenant, faith is your only ticket. Under the Old Covenant, one had to become a proselite to be blessed with Israel. But under the New Covenant, one required faith to be blessed with Abraham. God was opening up the possibility of others from outside of Israel 

The Corinthian church, much like the Galation church, had a mix of Jews and Gentiles. And the gifts of the spirit were poured out on both, quite irrespectively of whether they were physically circumcised or not. To partake in the blessings of the Bride (the children of Abraham), it wasn't enough to be a descendant of Abraham. Faith was required. God allowed the outsiders (the Gentiles) to partake in these blessings of Abraham (without being circumcised) to help illustrate this point.

.. note::

	By the end of this section, the "All Nations", "Abraham's Descendants", and "Bride" props will be set up.

The Husband 
===========

.. sidebar:: Key Points

	- If the only pieces we had available were about the children of Abraham, where would we look for blessing
	- But The bride is only half of the picture we are trying to understand
	- Paul speaks very specifically about a calling that is forming the perfect husband
	- Ephesians specifically speaks of Blessings that we get to enjoy, but these are not the blessings of Abraham, these are the Blessings of Christ Himself

Looking at this picture as an outsider, someone who is not a Jew, it looks like there are two ways to tap into God's blessing. Under the Old Covenant, it was possible to be blessed along with Israel by becoming a proscelyte. This required you to be circumcised and keep the law. And the best that could get you is the natural, earthly blessings of the law. While this was certainly good, it could never give eternal life. Under the New Covenant, God opened up the possibility of outsiders being blessed along side Abraham purely by faith. There was no circumcision required and no law to keep for these blessings. By faith, these Gentiles enjoyed eternal life and the same spiritual gifts that believing Isralites enjoyed. And these  blessings simply were not available under the Law. 

The question I want to ask is this: are we still missing some pieces or is this the full picture? If we want to receive blessings from God today, is the best that we can do being one of the children of Abraham? If this was the full picture, I guess I would have to say "yes". But it turns out there are a few more pieces we still have to look at. 

The question that we have to be asking ourselves right now is: who is the husband of the bride?

	[2Co 11:2 NKJV] 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.

.. note::

	Put the prop labeled "Christ" down in the place of the husband.

There is something worth pointing out about this picture right now. Talk about how bride is formed out of a group of believers. But as far as we can tell, the husband is formed by one, that is Christ Himself.

In Ephesians 4, Paul has something significant to say about the husband.

	[Eph 4:1 NKJV] 1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,

Paul is starting this chapter by encouraging those that he is addressing to walk according to how God has called them. And just a few verses down, I believe he clearly illustrates this calling:

	[Eph 4:11-16 NKJV] 11 And He Himself gave some [to be] apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 

There are two Greek words we need to look at very quickly before we can fully appreciate what Paul is really saying in verse 13. The word Paul uses here for "man" in the Greek is a word that can only refer to a male. In fact, it is the word that is used for "husband" in the Greek. This word appears seven times throughout the book of Ephesians, but only in chapters 4 and 5. Every other time it appears in Ephesians, it is translated "husband". The word "to" in the English translation of this verse is actually the word "eis" in the Greek. TBD research here.

It would actually be quite reasonable to translate this verse like the following:

	13 till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect husband, into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 

Paul then continues by saying:

	14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ-- 16 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.

The picture that Paul is painting here is that of a body of believers togheter with Christ as head forming the perfect husband. And yes, the word for "husband" here is the same word Paul used in Corinthians when he was betrothing the "bride" to her husband.

.. note::

	At this point, turn around the "Christ" prop and reveal "Husband".

Ephesians is the revelation of the perfect husband. Not just Himself. But Christ as head with a body of believers as part of the husband. And this body isn't made up of any particular outward distinctions. Mention Eph 2.

The blessing and the promise in Eph 1 is different than the blessing and promise given to Abraham. I believe we are sharing in the blessings given by the Father to Christ Himself. Instead of being blessed with faithful Abraham, we are blessed in the heavenly places in Christ.

	[Eph 1:3-4 NKJV] 3 Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly [places] in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,

Every spiritual blessing is far greater than the blessings that we a part of the law. I believe every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ is even greater and includes more than being blessed with faithful Abraham. These blessings can be no less amazing than what the children of Abraham enjoy, but they are specific to the role of the husband.

The Body of Christ
==================

We started this study by looking at a couple of puzzle pieces that both spoke of the body of Christ. One verse was in Corinthians and the other was in Ephesians, where we read

	[Eph 5:29-30 NKJV] 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord [does] the church. 30 For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.

Where does this verse fit? Explain how it fits into what we learned about in Eph. Explain the closeness. So this piece is speaking of the body of Christ, or the husband himself.

.. note::

	Puzzle piece for Ephesians is placed under the husband.

But what about that verse from 1 Cor?

	[1Co 12:27 KJV] 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

Explain who Paul is talking to in 1 Cor. It does not make sense that this would refer to the husband particularly since he is addressing the bride in these books. He's basically said you're not the husband, I want to present you to the husband. So as I see it, we can either brush this verse aside, or we can say that maybe Paul really does mean that the Bride is somehow also the body of Christ. How could this work?

The virgin in 2 Cor is espoused, but the wedding hasn't happened yet. According to this source, being espoused is just as legally binding under Jewish law as the marriage ceremony:

http://www.ndtime.net/jewish_wedding_traditions_marriage_customs_espoused_wife.htm

So, the espoused bride was legally treated as if she was married to her husband. There were really just some formalities that had to take place later.

In setting up this picture, we have gone as far back as Abraham. To complete this picture, we need to go all the way back to the creation of Adam to see what we can learn about the whole picture. Adam foreshadows or symbolizes Christ. In fact, in 1 Cor 15, Paul devotes a good amount of space to contrasting the first Adam with the last Adam, Jesus Christ. Understanding how Adam relates to Christ is essential.

In Genesis 2 the creation of the first man and woman is recorded. Adam is created first when God forms him from the dust of the ground and breaths into him the breath of life. Adam spends a period of time alone. Not much is said about this time, but he is probably spending it taking care of the creation God has given to him and naming the various living creatures. But through all of this, he was alone so far as human companionship is concerned:

	[Gen 2:20 NKJV] 20 So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.

How was Eve created? She was taken out of Adam. [elaborate]. Put down Eve prop. Why was Eve created? To help Adam. There was no help found for him at that point. Eve was Adam's helper. Together, they formed the first human couple.

Now for a tricky question: Were Adam and Eve one body or two bodies?. Or were they together one body with distinct purposes. In other words, they could both be different and somehow still be one body. Is that a possibility?

It is also significant that the Bride hasn't been formed yet. Adam existed for some time before Eve was taken out of Him. It is the same with Christ and His body. There are two distinct purposes that are formed out of Christ: the husband and the bride. The husband is formed first in Christ Himself. But the Bride is in some way formed out of the husband, just like Eve was formed out of Adam.

Discuss the difference between Adam's line "bone of my bone" and what Paul says in Eph 5, members of His bones. Will Christ (or the Lamb in revelatoin) one day say to His bride, this is bone of my bone.

Both Cor and Eph can take full force when we realize both of these callings can only be realized in the person of Christ. They are related, but they are different roles with different purposes and different bodies.

End with the fact that the picture on the box is Christ and the new creation that is being formed in him. Adam and Eve, the Nations and Israel are really shadows of this ultimate reality. This earthly picture is marred and distorted, but through God's plan of redemption, this picture is being corrected and will one day be put right.

Recap with how Isral was a helper for all other nations. Yes, they were to be a great nation. That was God's promise to Abraham. But they forgot that in order to be great, you need to be the servant of all. Those are the words of Christ to the descendants of Abraham.

Ultimately, I believe it still is in God's plan to channel earthly blessings through Israel to all Nations, but that day hasn't come yet. And I think that's why God left open the possibility of other nations participating along side with Israel. And I think that Israel will actually be a helper for all the other nations some day, but not until this serving God part is actualy figured out. [Bring in suitable quotes from Genesis here]. Need to be strategic about placing props on one vs two (separate chairs).

But now with Israel on the side for the time being, we can enjoy being blessed not merely with faithful Abraham, but with Christ Himself as part of the husband.
