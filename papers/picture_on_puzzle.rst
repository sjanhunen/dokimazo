The Picture on the Box
======================

What's the largest jigsaw puzzle you have ever put together?

I like to think of the Bible as a gigantic pizzle, where each verse forms a single piece.

So it's kind of like a big jig-saw puzzle with 31,120 little pieces in total.

How do you put together a large puzzle? You look at the picture on the box?

What is the picture on the box of the Bible?


Adam and Christ
===============

- Adam created in the image of God in Genesis
- Christ is the image of God in Revelation
- Linkage between the sacrifice in Genesis and the Lamb in Revelation
- Christ: the picture on the puzzle box
- When we are studying the Bible, we should ask what does this teach us about Christ?

Uniqueness of Paul in his teaching on Adam and Christ:
- Paul the only author that uses "body" in a symbolic sense
- Paul a significant teacher on Mystery in scripture
- Paul draws out significant parallels and contrasts between Adam and Christ
