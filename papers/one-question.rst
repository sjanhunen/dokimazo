One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to walk up to Jesus while he was in the flesh on the earth and ask Him one question, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzling or challenging passage in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something like this at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel actually had this very opportunity. Now I don't think that, from their perspective, they looked at it this way. In fact, these leaders saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he had repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy.

They wanted to act forcefully against Him, but they were afraid the people. So they devised a strategy: trying to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could ask Him hard questions and get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, then they would have him in their trap.

Looking back on this from our perspective, this is actually a pretty ironic or even comic scene. The person they are about to question is the "Word of God made flesh" (John 1:14). The Word of God made flesh: sharper than a two-edge sword, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Heb 4:12). It just strikes me that trying to trick somebody like that is a bad idea.

What's amazing about this scene recorded in Mark 12 is how Jesus takes something that was intended as a trap and uses it for powerful teaching in a way that I had never considered before.

TBD: I actually believe that these guys, while they were trying to entangle the Lord, actually asked Him questions that they themselves were struggling with.

The Pharisees & Herodians
-------------------------

The first question came from a group that was actually formed of two different sects, the Pharisees and the Herodians. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. They ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that the law.

The Herodians where a group distinct from the Pharisees and Sadducees that most scholars believe were very friendly to Herod the Great. In other words, they were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of Herod as King. They would have normally been at odds with the Pharisees over political differences, but they united with them in their attempt to trap Jesus.

They first attempt to butter up and flatter Jesus, and then they get around to asking their question:

   [Mar 12:14-15 KJV] 14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].

To understand where this question is coming from, we need to appreciate how the Pharisees approached tithing. Under the law of Moses, each tribe of Israel other than the tribe of Levi was required to pay ten percent to help support the tribe of Priests in their service of the nation. In other words, this was a divinely-instituted tax system.

The Pharisees made tithing much more than this: they would give a tenth of their mint, of their dill, of their spices, and so on. They became obsessed with giving a tenth of everything. They built an elaborate system around this. They stared to think that worshiping God was about tithing.

When they ask whether it's *lawful* to pay tax, they aren't referring to the law of Rome, they are referring to the law of Moses. In other words, they were asking "does the Law of God require us to pay our taxes". They framed this question expecting a simple "yes" or "no" answer, knowing they had laid the trap.

But of course, Christ saw through this and gave them an extremely insightful answer:

   [Mar 12:16-17 KJV] 16 And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

At a surface level, it would be easy to look at this answer and think that Christ simply avoided the trap and told the Pharisees to keep giving their tithes and keep paying their taxes. But I believe the Word of God is sharper than that and cuts deeper than that.

Christ knew what was going on in their heart, and this is what I believe he was discerning about them: "you may be tithing ten percent of everything you have, but you've actually given nothing to God. You may be paying your taxes, but deep down you hate doing it, and you are no better than someone who doesn't pay their tax". Or put another way "if you truly gave God what He wanted, you wouldn't have so much trouble giving Caesar some tax money that has his face stamped on it."

So, really, it all comes down to the question of "what does God want"? We'll get to the answer, but we have to keep reading.

The Sadducee
------------

Next up was the question from the Sadducee. This question centered around the doctrine of resurrection.

The Scribe
----------

The Scribe's question was about the law.

Christ acknowledges that this was a good question. In His answer, Christ points out that everything in fact all the law and the prophets hang on loving God with all the heart, mind, soul, and strength.

This was the only One to walk the face of the earth that actually kept the greatest commandment.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - The focal point of the ministry of Jesus was the heart: it is the source out from which everything flows
   - True faith (as opposed to religion or reason) is always from the heart

If we are to truly grasp the greatest commandment, we need to understand the key words used. What are these key words? Christ said we are to *love* God with all of our *heart*, *soul*, *mind*, and *strength*.

First and foremost is the commandment to *love* God. This is the word `agape`, the word that is used to describe God's sacrificial, giving love. The love that led the Father to give His only begotten Son for the world. Loving God isn't just some feeling or idea, it requires sacrifice. We must give our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength to Him.

Heart & Soul
------------

But what does it mean to love with one's heart and soul? In Mark 12, Christ is actually quoting an Old Testament passage found in Deuteronomy 6:5

   And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

To fully understand the greatest commandment we need to dig into the meaning of these Hebrew words.

Look at word counts for 'heart':
- Psalms is the winner with 133!
- Deut is one of the top books in the OT with 49!
- Does Jesus use this word more than mind, body, soul?


The phrase "heart and soul" is used numerous times throughout Deut. It really suggests that those two words really were used to describe the complete person.

Looking over Christ's own words, it's clear that the focus of His ministry is on the heart and soul. We need only to look right within the book of Mark to see a clear pattern. Jesus uses each of the words in his teaching the following number of times:

- Heart: 8x
- Soul: 8x
- Mind: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)
- Strength: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)

See might or strength really as an amplifier, not so much as a distinct thing to talk about. It is how you love God with heart & soul.

What's missing in this passage that is found in Mark? *Heart* and *soul* and *strength* (or might) are all present. But the word *mind* is absent. Why is that significant?

The Soul
--------

The challenge in understanding the word *soul* today is that fact that the common meaning of this word is colored heavily by Greek philosophy going all the way back to Plato. Plato's concept of the soul was that it was the immortal part of you that is distinct from your body. In fact, it is as if the soul is trapped inside the body. Upon death, the soul leaves the body and carries on in existence. Many of the Greek concepts of the soul have influenced popular Christian doctrine.

This stands in stark contrast to the Hebrew concept for soul found in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for soul is *nephesh*. We can get a pretty clear picture of the meaning of this word by looking at the first few occurrences of this word found in the creation account in Genesis. Interestingly enough, the first three appearances of this word are not even in reference to human beings:

   21 And God created great whales, and every living creature[H5315] that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
   
   24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature[H5315] after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
   
   30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life,[H5315] [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

The souls referred to here are living creatures that are in the water, on the land, and in the sky. In other words they are fish, cattle, and birds. In its fullest sense, the soul is a reference to the complete creature, and it is definitely not limited to humans. When we reach Adam (a human being), we read:

   7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.[H5315]

In other words, when God combined the body formed from dust with the breath or spirit He breathed into Adam, the result was a living creature.

Another challenge with the word soul is the fact that it can be used figuratively. Even though soul includes the entire living creature, it can be used figuratively to refer to only parts of the creature. For example, you will come across passages in Scripture that speak of a soul rejoicing or soul being troubled. This would be a figurative use of the word soul, where the word for the whole creature is used to represent an emotion or feeling that is in fact deep inside that creature. But if you really think about this, most things that are buried deep inside usually have a way of affecting the entire creature.

So loving God with all of your soul doesn't mean loving Him with some immaterial piece of you that is inside your body but separate from your body. It means loving God with the entire creature that He has made you to be. It is actually all encompassing.

The Heart
---------

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   Christ taught that the heart is the source out from which everything flows. A heart that is filled with the spirit of Christ is like building on the rock. The works will weather the storm. If you want to serve God, it must be from the heart.

When we think of this word, its natural for us to imagine a bodily organ that pumps blood. But the Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab*, which are translated *heart* in the Old Testament, literally mean the innermost part of something. So you will see these words used in such phrases as "the *heart* of the sea" or the "the *midst* of heaven".

When *leb* or *lebab* are spoken of in the human context, the *heart* represents the innermost part or central part of your soul. Life is described, in Proverbs 4:23, as flowing out of the heart:

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.

Another way to say this is that the heart is like the fountain of life in a person, the place out from which the activities and actions of life flow.

This understanding of the heart as the source of the activity of the soul is found throughout the teaching of Jesus. At one point the Pharasees were giving Him a hard time for not washing His hands before eating as was their custom. [Consider bringing in the brief question and His answer]. 

Christ used this as a moment for teaching (Mat 15:17-20):

   "Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are [the things] which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
   
In the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, Christ focuses on the importance of the heart in a series of contrasts where He says "you have heard it said" in the law, "but I say unto you". For example: 

- You have heard it said, "don't murder". But anyone who is angry without cause will be treated as if they had murdered.
- You have heard it said, "don't commit adultery". But anyone who lusts has committed adultery in their heart.
- And so on

The Pharisees, in their attempt to not break the law of God, added layer upon layer of protection around the law until it became almost unrecognizable. But none of this dealt with the source of the problem. Actually, the fact that so many layers were required to achieve a form out outward conformance is actually a testament to just how bad the problem was. Christ came to deal with the problem at its source. If the problem is deal with at the source, the law will be naturally fulfilled without effort. And none of the extra layers will be required. 

The law identified and punished the sinful external action, because that was its domain. But Christ came to deal with the root of all sinful actions: the heart. His ministry was a ministry focused on the heart. The healing and the feeding that He did was secondary to this. The Sermon on the Mount was a sermon about the heart. He didn't come to set aside the law, He came to deal with the problem at the source. In fact, this is the only way that the law can be truly fulfilled.

A brief "Cole's notes" edition of Deut would be helpful here. It will culminate with chapter 30. Deut 30:6 looks forward to the New Covenant. The cutting here is not in the flesh but in the heart. This is the only way to truly love God with all your heart and soul.

The circumcision of the flesh was part of the law. But the cutting of the heart was what God was really after. I believe that "circumcision of the heart" was the real theme of the ministry of Christ while He was on earth. His teaching and ministry was focused on the heart because everything else flows out from there.

Luke 6:43-49: the parable of the wise and foolish builder. Who is the rock? Christ (or His Spirit) Where is the rock? (In your heart). This is what serving God and pleasing God is all about.

The ministry Christ had with Israel was actually a heart-focused ministry. That's why it looked so radically different than the religion and the reason of the day. It was so different, it was unrecognizable to many people. The signs that Christ did were to confirm the promises given in the prophets, but His real work was focused on the heart.


A Man After God's Own Heart
===========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   David, despite his many failure, was seeking God from the heart. He didn't run from the conviction of sin, he embraced it. His heart was broken, not hardened. He desired what only God can give, a clean heart filled with His spirit.

No study of the heart would be complete without considering the example of someone who was called out in the Bible as being a "man after God's own heart." This is none other than David. Why did David get this title?

It was in Saul's disobedience that the Lord said he would seek out a king that was after His own heart. In other words, Samuel is saying to Saul that you don't really get it. Your heart is not where it needs to be when it comes to obeying the Lord. Saul just didn't get what obeying the Lord was about. Externally, he had a lot going for him. But he was disobedient to the Lord. I believe he was disobedient because he didn't "get it" in his heart. And so the Lord ultimately replaced him with David as king.

David committed some pretty serious sins. Thinking of the big two, he committed both murder and adultery. How could God call a murderer and an adulterer someone after His own heart? I believe this is because David "got it" in a way that Saul never did. We can understand this by looking at how David responded to sin.

Psalm 51 is David's response after being confronted with his serious sin.

   [Psa 51:2-4, 6, 10, 16-17 KJV] 2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. ... 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ... 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ... 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

David's encounter with the truth led to a broken spirit and a broken heart. When David acknowledged his sin, he didn't go make a burnt offering to God. He acknowledged that he just couldn't do it without God's help: that is what God wanted more than burnt offerings. This is something God does not despise. David asked for something that only God could provide. What David is asking for can only be answered in Christ:

   [Isa 61:1 KJV] 1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound;

This is how Christ described His own ministry. His ministry was to those who were the brokenhearted under the Old Covenant. The cry of David's heart was answered in the Son of David, Jesus Christ. A broken heart is an open heart. Psalm 129:23 - "Search me and know my heart". David is saying, God my heart is open to you.

Old Covenant: The Law was an encounter with the Word of God. More than burnt offerings and sacrifices, the Lord desired a broken heart and a broken spirit. In fact, this was the intended outcome of the Law. The alternative outcome was a blinded, hardened heart that wasn't touched by God. Only two responses are possible to the Law: being broken or being blinded.

New Covenant: The very best the Law could do is "break your heart". But, thankfully, Christ came for those with a broken heart. That's what His ministry was all about. When God puts His Spirit and His Law into the hearts of the New Covenant people, Israel will be the nation that God always wanted. All the other nations of the world will take notice of this incredible nation.

Unfortunately for the nation of Israel, not many had a heart like David's. They had opportunities to repent time and again. God was incredibly patient with them. 
But most of Israel had the opposite of a broken heart: a hardened heart. The only way the nation of Israel will fulfill the purpose God has for them is through a broken heart, not a hard heart.

The great irony is that the one nation that was supposed to be a light and an example stumbled and was hardened. Someday, as the prophet Zechariah says, they will look on the one that they pierced and they will understand. Their heart will be opened to Him.


The Greatest Prayer
===================

.. sidebar:: Main Point

   Relationship with God has always been about the heart and it is today more than ever.

   Our hearts must be opened and filled in order for us to fulfill the purpose that God has for us. Asking Him to fill our open hearts really is the greatest thing we can pray for.

Even though Israel is in a blinded, hardened state now, God has an incredible plan He is working out through the heart of people from all nations. Paul is speaking specifically about this in the book of Ephesians.

Need to figure out how to tie in the Mystery revelation with the heart. God is accomplishing something big by focusing on the heart, quite apart from any laws and covenants. Today, God is using people out of all nations who have none of the advantages that Israel had. He is working through their hearts. It's not about one nation being above all others, but about all nations together (with Christ dwelling in their hearts) serving God.

Israel wasn't the only nation that struggled with hardened hearts:

   [Eph 4:18 KJV] 18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness[G4457] of their heart:

The word blindness is also translated "hardness". It means a covering over something.

I think the greatest prayer is recorded in Eph 3:

   [Eph 3:14-19 NKJV] 14 For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height-- 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

I believe this is really what is at the center of the Mystery. The covenants are all about how God gets one special nation to the point of serving all other nations and being an example to them. The Mystery is about Christ dwelling in the hearts of all nations and all nations without distinction serving Him and being an example to the heavenly leadership.

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- It's not the law in our hearts, but it's Christ, the one who fulfills the law (and so much more), dwelling in our hearts
- God reveals mysteries to us so we can understand His heart, not so we can explain complex Bible passages
- Knowing the love of Christ is being in tune with the heart of God. 
- Doing everything heartily means doing it from the heart so that it can include the whole soul.
- It's not what we do. It's not even how we do it. Really, it's why we do what we do. That's really getting to the heart of the matter.

The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices). What kind of witness to the principalities and power was the perfect love and obedience that Christ showed from His heart?

Even though the scene of the cross was done in the wide open for everyone to see, at that exact time, nobody really knew what it was about or just how far reaching the implications would be. When we look back on that event, it all begins to make sense. I wonder if something similar might happen in our lives. Think about how Christ said to do your good works in secret. The Mystery of God's will was the unspoken aspect of the cross. It was known between the Father and the Son, but it was kept as a secret between them until God saw fit to reveal it through Paul.
