One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to meet God face to face and ask one question, what would it be? 

In Mark 12, we read about three different religious leaders of Israel that had this opportunity. One was a Pharisee, one was a Sadducee, and one was a Scribe. Based on what is recorded, it's unlikely that any of these men actually thought this was their chance to ask God a question. But their inability to perceive this does not change the fact that they were talking with the God of Israel, the One whom they thought they were serving. It's fun for us to watch the situatoin unfold with this knowledge. They saw him as an up and coming leader and a threat. We know Him as the Son of God. This difference leads to quite the ironic encounter. The leaders were well aware that Jesus was speaking out against them. They wanted to arrest Him, but couldn't due to the popularity that Jesus had among the people. So they decided on a different strategy: trying to trap Him with His own words. Put another way: they decided to try to trick God by asking Him hard questions.

The Pharisee

First up is the Pharisee. 

The Sadducee

The next question comes from a Sadducee.

The Scribe

The final question comes from a Scribe. This one really is approaching a good question.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

- Terms heart, soul, mind, strength in Mark and Deut
- Heart & soul versus mind & body
- Paul's commentary on the barriers to belief
  - The Jew wanted a sign, but saw the cross as weak (show me the power)
  - The Greek wanted wisdom, but saw the cross as foolish (convince me with your logical arguments)
- Hebrew vs Greek thought: "I think therefore I am" 
- Knowledge vs acknowledge

Main Point:

- Loving God with all the soul must start with the heart
- We can stumble at the external manifestations
- We can stumble at the intellectual level
- God wants us to want the same things He wants

Three Kings
===========

Illustrations from the lives of David & Solomon

Saul
----
external conformance, but didn't "get it"

Solomon
-------
gave his heart over to the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge

David
-----

the only one described as a man after God's own heart

Compare the prayers of these two kings. What did they ask God for? What did they pray for?

The Greatest Prayer
===================

Q: Is the central prayer in Ephesians the only prayer that specificaly talks about Christ dwelling in our hearts?

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- The one thing that Paul felt was most important to pray about
- The one and best thing we can ask for is Christ dwelling in our hearts. Isn't this infinitely better than everything else? But we tend to grasp after knowledge instead of this.
- The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices)
- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
- Paul isn't praying for academic wisdom as he is praying for a heart after God.

Main Point:

 - God reveals mysteries to us so we can understand His heart, not so we can explain complex Bible passages
 - Doing everything heartily means doing it from the heart!
