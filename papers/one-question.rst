One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to meet God face to face and ask for one thing, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzle in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel unknowingly each had this very opportunity. This encounter recorded in Mark 12 develops into an ironic scene when we look back upon it with a full understanding of who Jesus is and what His message was about.

The leaders of the time saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy. They wanted to act forcefully against Jesus, but they feared the people. So they devised a different strategy: they decided to try to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, they could use this to finally act against Him.

These guys had gotten so disoriented and distorted in their perception of reality that they were about to try to trap the very God (manifested in human form) that they thought they were serving. They really had no idea what they were walking into. They are about to encounter the Truth.

   In order for you to be able to truly give something to God, not only do you have to know His word and His power, you have to love Him with all of your heart, and mind, and soul, and strength.

   Each of these three leaders were missing something from the complete picture.


The Pharisee
------------

The first question came from a group formed of two different sects, the Pharisees and the Herodians. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. Where they ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that they were just serving themselves.

The Herodians where a group distinct from the Pharisees and Sadducees that most scholars believe were very friendly to Herod the Great. In other words, they were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of Herod as King. They would have normally been at odds with the Pharisees over this political difference, but they united in their attempt to trap Jesus.

The question they ask was simple: "is it lawful to pay tribue to Caesar?"

Is it lawful would be a reference to Mosaic law.

I think the Pharisee was anticipating a simple "yes" or "no" answer to this question. Christ answered neither.

Christ proposes two "renderings" in His answer. The reality is that they really weren't doing either. Rendering to God the things that are Gods isn't primarily about coins. I believe Christ was talking about the intent of the heart. As the Word made flesh, Christ was discerning the hearts of the people He ministered to (Heb 4:12).

The Pharisee was religiously tithing ten percent of everything he owned. But was he actually giving anything to God?

The Sadducee
------------

Next up was the question from the Sadducee. This question centered around the doctrine of resurrection.

The Scribe
----------

The Scribe's question was about the law.

Christ acknowledges that this was a good question. In His answer, Christ points out that everything in fact all the law and the prophets hang on loving God with all the heart, mind, soul, and strength.

This was the only One to walk the face of the earth that actually kept the greatest commandment.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - The focal point of the ministry of Jesus was the heart: it is the source out from which everything flows
   - True faith (as opposed to religion or reason) is always from the heart

If we are to truly grasp the greatest commandment, we need to understand the key words used. What are these key words? Christ said we are to *love* God with all of our *heart*, *soul*, *mind*, and *strength*.

First and foremost is the commandment to *love* God. This is the word `agape`, the word that is used to describe God's sacrificial, giving love. The love that led the Father to give His only begotten Son for the world. Loving God isn't just some feeling or idea, it requires sacrifice. We must give our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength to Him.

Heart & Soul
------------

But what does it mean to love with one's heart and soul? In Mark 12, Christ is actually quoting an Old Testament passage found in Deuteronomy 6:5

   And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

To fully understand the greatest commandment we need to dig into the meaning of these Hebrew words.

Look at word counts for 'heart':
- Psalms is the winner with 133!
- Deut is one of the top books in the OT with 49!
- Does Jesus use this word more than mind, body, soul?


The phrase "heart and soul" is used numerous times throughout Deut. It really suggests that those two words really were used to describe the complete person.

Looking over Christ's own words, it's clear that the focus of His ministry is on the heart and soul. We need only to look right within the book of Mark to see a clear pattern. Jesus uses each of the words in his teaching the following number of times:

- Heart: 8x
- Soul: 8x
- Mind: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)
- Strength: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)

See might or strength really as an amplifier, not so much as a distinct thing to talk about. It is how you love God with heart & soul.

What's missing in this passage that is found in Mark? *Heart* and *soul* and *strength* (or might) are all present. But the word *mind* is absent. Why is that significant?

The Soul
--------

The challenge in understanding the word *soul* today is that fact that the common meaning of this word is colored heavily by Greek philosophy going all the way back to Plato. Plato's concept of the soul was that it was the immortal part of you that is distinct from your body. In fact, it is as if the soul is trapped inside the body. Upon death, the soul leaves the body and carries on in existence. Many of the Greek concepts of the soul have influenced popular Christian doctrine.

This stands in stark contrast to the Hebrew concept for soul found in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for soul is *nephesh*. We can get a pretty clear picture of the meaning of this word by looking at the first few occurrences of this word found in the creation account in Genesis. Interestingly enough, the first three appearances of this word are not even in reference to human beings:

   21 And God created great whales, and every living creature[H5315] that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
   
   24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature[H5315] after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
   
   30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life,[H5315] [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

The souls referred to here are living creatures that are in the water, on the land, and in the sky. In other words they are fish, cattle, and birds. In its fullest sense, the soul is a reference to the complete creature, and it is definitely not limited to humans. When we reach Adam (a human being), we read:

   7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.[H5315]

In other words, when God combined the body formed from dust with the breath or spirit He breathed into Adam, the result was a living creature.

Another challenge with the word soul is the fact that it can be used figuratively. Even though soul includes the entire living creature, it can be used figuratively to refer to only parts of the creature. For example, you will come across passages in Scripture that speak of a soul rejoicing or soul being troubled. This would be a figurative use of the word soul, where the word for the whole creature is used to represent an emotion or feeling that is in fact deep inside that creature. But if you really think about this, most things that are buried deep inside usually have a way of affecting the entire creature.

So loving God with all of your soul doesn't mean loving Him with some immaterial piece of you that is inside your body but separate from your body. It means loving God with the entire creature that He has made you to be. It is actually all encompassing.

The Heart
---------

What can we say about the heart? When we think of this word, its natural for us to imagine a bodily organ that pumps blood. But the Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab*, which are translated *heart* in the Old Testament, literally mean the innermost part of something. So you will see these words used in such phrases as "the *heart* of the sea" or the "the *midst* of heaven".

When *leb* or *lebab* are spoken of in the human context, the *heart* represents the innermost part or central part of your soul. Life is described, in Proverbs 4:23, as flowing out of the heart:

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.

Another way to say this is that the heart is like the fountain of life in a person, the place out from which the activities and actions of life flow.

This understanding of the heart as the source of the activity of the soul is found throughout the teaching of Jesus. At one point the Pharasees were giving Him a hard time for not washing His hands before eating as was their custom. [Consider bringing in the brief question and His answer]. Christ used this as a moment for teaching (Mat 15:17-20):

   "Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are [the things] which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
   
In the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, Christ focuses on the importance of the heart in a series of contrasts where He says "you have heard it said" in the law, "but I say unto you". For example: 

- You have heard it said, "don't murder". But anyone who is anngry without cause will be treated as if they had murdered.
- You have heard it said, "don't commit adultry". But anyone who lusts has committed adultry in their heart.
- And so on

The law identified and punished the sinful external action, because that was its domain. But Christ came to deal with the root of all sinful actions: the heart. His ministry was a ministry focused on the heart. The healing and the feeding that He did was secondary to this. The Sermon on the Mount was a sermon about the heart. He didn't come to set aside the law, He came to deal with the problem at the source. In fact, this is the only way that the law can be truly fulfilled.

Luke 6:45-49: the parable of the wise and foolish builder. Who is the rock? Christ (or His Spirit) Where is the rock? (In your heart).

A brief "Cole's notes" edition of Deut would be helpful here. It will culminate with chapter 30. Deut 30:6 looks forward to the New Covenant. The cutting here is not in the flesh but in the heart. This is the only way to truly love God with all your heart and soul.

The circumcision of the flesh was part of the law. But the cutting of the heart was what God was really after. I believe that "circumcision of the heart" was the real theme of the ministry of Christ while He was on earth. His teaching and ministry was focused on the heart because everything else flows out from there.

Matt 15:8-11: Honour with lips, but heart far from God. Vain worship. How much of Christianity today is vain worship? How much of what we do is vain worship?

The Pharisees, in their attempt to not break the law of God, added layer upon layer of protection around the law until it became almost unrecognizable. But none of this dealt with the source of the problem. Actually, the fact that so many layers were required to achieve a form out outward conformance is actually a testament to just how bad the problem was. Christ came to deal with the problem at its source. If the problem is deal with at the source, the law will be naturally fulfilled without effort. And none of the extra layers will be required. 

This is a direct answer to honoring God with your lips but having your heart very far from Him (Isa 29:13). Christ quotes this in Matthew. Theory: The ministry Christ had with Israel was actually a heart-focused ministry. That's why it looked so radically different than the religion and the reason of the day. It was so different, it was unrecognizable to many people. The signs that Christ did were to confirm the promises given in the prophets, but His real work was focused on the heart.

The ministry of Christ was really about the heart of Israel. He was the mediator of the New Covenant and His goal was to prepare them for this role by starting with the heart.

A Man After God's Own Heart
===========================

We can't be looking at the heart in like this without considering the example of someone who was called out as being a "man after God's own heart." Of course, I am speaking of King David. 

Burnt offerings have a way of coming up again and again. This time, Israel is in war with the Phiistines and is running scared. The prophet Samuel is delayed. Samuel is supposed to come and offer a sacrifice. Saul was supposed to wait for Samuel, but he got impatient and offered it himeslf. What is the significance of this act of disobedience? Expand upon it.

In response to this disobedience, Samuel tells Saul point blank that God is going to replace him as king. The Lord was going to find someone after His own heart. He was speacking, of course, of David.

Later in chapter 15, after another act of disobedience, Samuel says this to Saul:

[1Sa 15:22-23 NKJV] 22 So Samuel said: "Has the LORD [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, [And] to heed than the fat of rams. 23 For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He also has rejected you from [being] king."

Saul just didn't get what obeying the Lord was about. Externally, he had a lot going for him. But he was disobedient to the Lord. I believe he was disobedient because he didn't "get it" in his heart. And so the Lord ultimately replaced him with David as king.

David committed some pretty serious sins. Thinking of the big two, he committed both murder and adultery. How could God call a murderer and an adulterer someone after His own heart? I believe this is becuase David "got it" in a way that Saul never did. We can understand this by looking at how David responsed to sin.

David's Response to Sin
-----------------------

How did he respond when confronted with His sin? He understood it was about the heart!

Psalm 51 is David's response after being confronted with his serious sin.

   [Psa 51:2-4, 6, 10, 16-17 KJV] 2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. ... 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ... 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ... 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

When David acknowledged his sin, he didn't go make a burnt offering to God. He went straight to the heart of the problem, his own heart.

Where was his treasure? What did he talk about in his prayers?

Psalm 119:11 - God's Word in the heart.

Psalm 129:23 - "Search me and know my heart"

Paul's Response to Sin
----------------------

Bring in Romans to show the transition that takes place from Romans 7 to Romans 8. Response to sin is, again, key.

God wants us to acknowledge that at the very core of who we are, we want things and we do things that aren't right. It's so easy to deny this or to run from this. It's so easy to build layers of self serving religion around this. But when we acknowledge the truth and we let Him in to do the heart surgery, things are so much better.

The Greatest Prayer
===================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - Christ dwelling in our hearts is the single most important thing we can ask for
   - God reveals mysteries to us so we can understand His heart, not so we can explain complex Bible passages
   - Christ's obedience to the Father was the wisdom and power of God. He wanted what God wanted.
   - Doing everything heartily means doing it from the heart!

Compare the covenants to the Mystery. The Mystery is really about an even bigger purpose than any covenant. Think about what is said about the heart in both. Which is more? Which is greater? Who is being witnessed to with the Mystery versus Israel's role as priests? God wants a heart-to-heart relationship not just with the pepole of the New Covenant, but with people from all nations. If you really think about it, the nation of Israel was intended to serve all other nations and be an example. When we get to Ephesians, Paul is addressing people that were "strangers from the covenants". And what is at the core of his message?

Is the central prayer in Ephesians the only prayer that specifically talks about Christ dwelling in our hearts?

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- The one thing that Paul felt was most important to pray about
- The one and best thing we can ask for is Christ dwelling in our hearts. Isn't this infinitely better than everything else? But we tend to grasp after knowledge instead of this.
- The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices)
- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
- Paul isn't praying for academic wisdom as he is praying for a heart after God.
- What kind of witness to the principalities and power was the perfect love and obedience that Christ showed from His heart?

Even though the scene of the cross was done in the wide open for everyone to see, at that exact time, nobody really knew what it was about or just how far reaching the implications would be. When we look back on that event, it all begins to make sense. I wonder if something similar might happen in our lives. Think about how Christ said to do your good works in secret.
