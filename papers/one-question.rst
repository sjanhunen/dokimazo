One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to meet God face to face and ask for one thing, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzle in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel unknowingly each had this very opportunity. This encounter recorded in Mark 12 develops into an ironic scene when we look back upon it with a full understanding of who Jesus is and what His message was about.

The leaders of the time saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy. They wanted to act forcefully against Jesus, but they feared the people. So they devised a different strategy: they decided to try to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, they could use this to finally act against Him.

These guys had gotten so disoriented and distorted in their perception of reality that they were about to try to trap the very God (manifested in human form) that they thought they were serving. They really had no idea what they were walking into. They are about to encounter the Truth.

   In order for you to be able to truly give something to God, not only do you have to know His word and His power, you have to love Him with all of your heart, and mind, and soul, and strength.

   Each of these three leaders were missing something from the complete picture.


The Pharisee
------------

The first question came from a group formed of two different sects, the Pharisees and the Herodians. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. Where they ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that they were just serving themselves.

The Herodians where a group distinct from the Pharisees and Sadducees that most scholars believe were very friendly to Herod the Great. In other words, they were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of Herod as King. They would have normally been at odds with the Pharisees over this political difference, but they united in their attempt to trap Jesus.

The question they ask was simple: "is it lawful to pay tribue to Caesar?"

Is it lawful would be a reference to Mosaic law.

I think the Pharisee was anticipating a simple "yes" or "no" answer to this question. Christ answered neither.

Christ proposes two "renderings" in His answer. The reality is that they really weren't doing either. Rendering to God the things that are Gods isn't primarily about coins. I believe Christ was talking about the intent of the heart. As the Word made flesh, Christ was discerning the hearts of the people He ministered to (Heb 4:12).

The Pharisee was religiously tithing ten percent of everything he owned. But was he actually giving anything to God?

The Sadducee
------------

Next up was the question from the Sadducee. This question centered around the doctrine of resurrection.

The Scribe
----------

The Scribe's question was about the law.

Christ acknowledges that this was a good question. In His answer, Christ points out that everything in fact all the law and the prophets hang on loving God with all the heart, mind, soul, and strength.

This was the only One to walk the face of the earth that actually kept the greatest commandment.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - The focal point of the ministry of Jesus was the heart: it is the source out from which everything flows
   - True faith (as opposed to religion or reason) is always from the heart

If we are to truly grasp the greatest commandment, we need to understand the key words used. What are these key words? Christ said we are to *love* God with all of our *heart*, *soul*, *mind*, and *strength*.

First and foremost is the commandment to *love* God. This is the word `agape`, the word that is used to describe God's sacrificial, giving love. The love that led the Father to give His only begotten Son for the world. Loving God isn't just some feeling or idea, it requires sacrifice. We must give our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength to Him.

But what does it mean to love with one's heart and soul? In Mark 12, Christ is actually quoting an Old Testament passage found in Deuteronomy 6:5

   And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

To fully understand the greatest commandment we need to dig into the meaning of these Hebrew words.

The Soul
--------

The challenge in understanding the word *soul* today is that fact that the common meaning of this word is colored heavily by Greek philosophy going all the way back to Plato. Plato's concept of the soul was that it was the immortal part of you that is distinct from your body. In fact, it is as if the soul is trapped inside the body. Upon death, the soul leaves the body and carries on in existence. Many of the Greek concepts of the soul have influenced popular Christian doctrine.

This stands in stark contrast to the Hebrew concept for soul found in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for soul is *nephesh*. We can get a pretty clear picture of the meaning of this word by looking at the first few occurrences of this word found in the creation account in Genesis. Interestingly enough, the first three appearances of this word are not even in reference to human beings:

   21 And God created great whales, and every living creature[H5315] that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
   
   24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature[H5315] after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
   
   30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life,[H5315] [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

The souls referred to here are living creatures that are in the water, on the land, and in the sky. In other words they are fish, cattle, and birds. In its fullest sense, the soul is a reference to the complete creature, and it is definitely not limited to humans. When we reach Adam (a human being), we read:

   7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.[H5315]

In other words, when God combined the body formed from dust with the breath or spirit He breathed into Adam, the result was a living creature.

Another challenge with the word soul is the fact that it can be used figuratively. Even though soul includes the entire living creature, it can be used figuratively to refer to only parts of the creature. For example, you will come across passages in Scripture that speak of a soul rejoicing or soul being troubled. This would be a figurative use of the word soul, where the word for the whole creature is used to represent an emotion or feeling that is in fact deep inside that creature. But if you really think about this, most things that are buried deep inside usually have a way of affecting the entire creature.

So loving God with all of your soul doesn't mean loving Him with some immaterial piece of you that is inside your body but separate from your body. It means loving God with the entire creature that He has made you to be. It is actually all encompassing.

The Heart
---------

What can we say about the heart? When we think of this word, its natural for us to think of a bodily organ that pumps blood. But the Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab*, which are translated *heart* in the Old Testament, literally mean the innermost part of something. So you will see them used in such phrases as "the *heart* of the sea" or the "the *midst* of heaven".

When applied to human beings, the *heart* represents the innermost part or central part of your soul. Life is described, in Proverbs 4:23, as flowing out of the heart:

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.

Another way to say this is that the heart is like the fountain of life in a person, the place out from which life flows.

Illustrations on this from ministry of Christ:

- Matt 6:21
- Luke 6:45-49
- Matt 15:8-11
- Matt 12:34

Look at word counts for 'heart':

- Psalms is the winner with 133!
- Deut is one of the top books in the OT with 49!
- Does Jesus use this word more than mind, body, soul?

A brief "Cole's notes" edition of Deut would be helpful here. It will culminate with chapter 30. Deut 30:6 looks forward to the New Covenant. The cutting here is not in the flesh but in the heart. This is the only way to truly love God with all your heart and soul.

The circumcision of the flesh was part of the law. But the cutting of the heart was what God was really after. I believe that "circumcision of the heart" was the real theme of the ministry of Christ while He was on earth. His teaching and ministry was focused on the heart because everything else flows out from there.

This relationship between heart (where your treasure is) and mouth (what flows out of that) is clearly seen in passages that speak of salvation. For example, Paul says in Romans 10

    9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
    10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

This is a direct answer to honoring God with your lips but having your heart very far from Him (Isa 29:13). Christ quotes this in Matthew. Theory: The ministry Christ had with Israel was actually a heart-focused ministry. That's why it looked so radically different than the religion and the reason of the day. It was so different, it was unrecognizable to many people. The signs that Christ did were to confirm the promises given in the prophets, but His real work was focused on the heart.

The heart determines what we focus on:
  
  - What we focus on is where our treasure is
  - What we talk about flows directly out of our heart

The ministry of Christ was really about the heart of Israel. He was the mediator of the New Covenant and His goal was to prepare them for this role by starting with the heart.


Heart & Soul
------------

The phrase "heart and soul" is used numerous times throughout Deut. It really suggests that those two words really were used to describe the complete person.

See might or strength really as an amplifier, not so much as a distinct thing to talk about. It is how you love God with heart & soul.

The Mind
--------

What's missing in this passage that is found in Mark? *Heart* and *soul* and *strength* (or might) are all present. But the word *mind* is absent. Why is that significant?

David: A Man After God's Own Heart
==================================

David stands out among the first 3 kings of Israel. He is the only one described as being a man after God's own heart. What can we learn from his life?

Where was his treasure? What did he talk about in his prayers?

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - David's focus on God's heart kept him on track despite many failures
   - Saul had a focus on the external that led him down the road of jealously and hatred
   - Solomon's pursuit of wisdom led him astray in some ways

Deut 17:17-20: This describes a king after God's heart is wisdom that Solomon didn't follow


Bring in Romans to show the transition that takes place from Romans 7 to Romans 8. David asked God to create a clean heart in him.


The Greatest Prayer
===================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - Christ dwelling in our hearts is the single most important thing we can ask for
   - God reveals mysteries to us so we can understand His heart, not so we can explain complex Bible passages
   - Christ's obedience to the Father was the wisdom and power of God. He wanted what God wanted.
   - Doing everything heartily means doing it from the heart!

Discuss key points of Old Covenant, New Covenant, and Mystery. How does the heart fit into all of these. How has the structure of a relationshop with God changed?

Compare the covenants to the Mystery. The Mystery is really about an even bigger purpose than any covenant. Think about what is said about the heart in both. Which is more? Which is greater? Who is being witnessed to with the Mystery versus Israel's role as priests?

Is the central prayer in Ephesians the only prayer that specifically talks about Christ dwelling in our hearts?

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- The one thing that Paul felt was most important to pray about
- The one and best thing we can ask for is Christ dwelling in our hearts. Isn't this infinitely better than everything else? But we tend to grasp after knowledge instead of this.
- The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices)
- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
- Paul isn't praying for academic wisdom as he is praying for a heart after God.
