One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to ask God one question face to face, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzling or challenging passage in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something like this at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel actually had this very opportunity. Now I don't think that, from their perspective, they looked at it this way. In fact, these leaders saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he had repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy.

They wanted to act forcefully against Him, but they were afraid the people. So they devised a strategy: trying to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could ask Him hard questions and get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, then they would have him in their trap.

Looking back on this from our perspective, this is actually a pretty ironic. The person they are about to question is the "Word of God made flesh" (John 1:14). The Word of God made flesh: sharper than a two-edge sword, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Heb 4:12). Trying to to trick this person is a bad idea. But Christ skillfully takes something that was intended as a trap and uses it for powerful teaching.

The Pharisees
-------------

The first question came from the Pharisees. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. They ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that the law really became unrecognizable:

   [Mar 12:14-15 KJV] 14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give?

They first attempt to butter up and flatter Jesus, and then they get around to asking their question. To understand where this question is coming from, we need to appreciate how the Pharisees approached tithing. Under the law of Moses, each tribe of Israel other than the tribe of Levi was required to pay ten percent to help support the tribe of Priests in their service of the nation. In other words, this was a divinely-instituted tax system.

The Pharisees made tithing much more than this: they would give a tenth of their mint, of their dill, of their spices, and so on. They became obsessed with giving a tenth of everything. They built an elaborate system around this. They stared to think that worshiping God was about tithing.

When they ask whether it's *lawful* to pay tax, they aren't referring to the law of Rome, they are referring to the law of Moses. In other words, they were asking "does the Law of God require us to pay our taxes". They would see paying taxes as a form of worship to Caesar. hThey framed this question expecting a simple "yes" or "no" answer, knowing they had laid the trap.

But of course, Christ saw through this and gave them an extremely insightful answer:

   [Mar 12:15-17 KJV] But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it]. 16 And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

At a surface level, it would be easy to look at this answer and think that Christ simply avoided the trap and told the Pharisees to keep giving their tithes and keep paying their taxes. But I believe the Word of God is sharper than that and cuts deeper than that.

Christ knew what was going on in their heart, and this is what I believe he was discerning about them: "you may be tithing ten percent of everything you have, but you've actually given nothing to God. You may be paying your taxes, but deep down you hate doing it, and you are no different than someone who doesn't pay their taxes". Or put another way "if you truly gave God what He wanted, you wouldn't have so much trouble giving Caesar some tax money that has his face stamped on it."

The Phairsees distorted the Word of God by adding all their tradition to it to make it into something that served themselves.

The Sadducee
------------

The next question came from a Sadducee. The Sadducees were a religious sect that were opposed to all the added traditions of the Pharisees that weren't found in the Torah. They believed strongly that the written Word was the only authoritative source for doctrine. They also happened to deny the truth of resurrection. This, and other disagreements, put them at odds with the Pharisees. Sp they were probably glad to see the Pharisees put in their place with the first question.

The Sadducee came to Jesus with a hypothetical question about the doctrine of resurrection that involved seven brothers that had each married, and then died soon thereafter. The catch here was that they all married the same woman in succession:

   [Mar 12:23-24 KJV] 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

How could resurrection ever take place, they were thinking, if you have a scenero like this. Of course, Christ knew there was no real problem here and pointed out the source of their difficulty:

   [Mar 12:24-25 KJV] 24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

The Sadducees distorted the Word of God by leaving things out. And ultimately they were again using the Scriptures to serve themselves.

The Scribe
----------

Seeing how well Jesus had answered the Sadducee, a Scribe decided to ask a skill testing question. The Scribes were the keepers and teachers of the Law. They liked to sort, categorize, organize, and study the commandments. Perhaps they even got into debates over which commandments were most important:

   [Mar 12:28 KJV] 28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
   
Christ answers this simply and directly with insight that actually applies to all three questions:

   [Mar 12:29-31 KJV] 29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment. 31 And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

Remember the coin that was stamped with Caesar's image on it? Man was created in the image of God. We have God's image stamped on us. If we are to render unto God the things that are God's, that involves the whole person. It's one thing to read, teach, and debate the Words of God. But its an entirely different thing to understand them from your heart and to want what God wants from the heart. That involves the entire person.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

The greatest commandment is about *love*: first and foremost loving God, and then loving other people. And they are related: loving God leads to loving other people.

This love is not a feeling or emotion, it is service and sacrifice. The word for *love* is the same word used in John 3:16 "for God so *loved* the word that He *gave*". So loving with the heart, soul, mind, and strength is serving Him with the heart, soul, mind, and strength.

Heart & Soul
------------

It turns out that heart and soul are actually the real key words to understanding the greatest commandment. And they are, in fact, closely related. To see this, we need to go back to the passage in Deuteronomy that Christ was quoting in Mark:

   [Deu 6:4-6 KJV] 4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD: 5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:

Which word is missing here that was present in Mark? *Heart* and *soul* and *strength* (or might) are all present. But the word *mind* is absent. Why is this significant?

We must keep in mind that Deuteronomy was written long before Mark, and it was written from a Hebrew perspective. The people that Jesus was addressing in Mark were living in a culture that had been influenced by Greek philosophers like Plato for hundreds of years. And to Plato, the mind was a big deal. In fact, he believed that one could arrive at ultimate or absolute truth through use of the mind or the intellect. The mind was so elevated that it had practically become a god. The mind was viewed as a central part of the immortal soul.

But all of this is contrary to a true Scriptural understanding of the mind. Scripture teaches that the heart is the deepest part of the person. The heart is where our desires, our will, comes from. And it is actually the heart that steers the rational mind.

In Romans chapter 1, Paul describes the sad path of nations that resisted the truth of God and went after idols. It started when those nations failed to glorify God as God (Rom 1:21). This resulted in their foolish heart being darkened. Finally, God gave them over to a reprobate mind that led to all sorts of activities not in line with the heart of God (Rom 1:28). Not glorifying God led to a darkened heart which led to a reprobate mind. The heart actually steered the mind off course.

Christ acknowledges the importance of the rational mind as part of a complete person, but I don't believe it was the major focus of his teaching. You can see this quite easily by looking at how many times he actually uses the word. Just looking at the words spoken by Christ in the book of Mark uncovers the following:

- Heart: 8x
- Soul: 8x
- Mind: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)

It's fair to say that Christ focused on the heart and soul in His teaching. He speaks about them 8 times more frequently than the mind throughout the book of Mark.

Looking back at the book of Deuteronomy, it turns out it's filled with references to the heart. In fact, out of all the books in the Old Testament, it's one of the top books about the heart with 49 references to 'heart'. Imagine that, a book of Moses that's a book on the heart. The book of Psalms does beat it out with 133 reference.

Out of those 49 references to heart in Deuteronomy, ten of them are actually the phrase "heart and soul." This is very fitting seeing that there are ten commandments. And the whole law can be summed up by loving God with all of your heart and your soul.

The Soul
--------

The challenge in understanding the word *soul* is that fact that the common meaning of this word is colored heavily by Greek philosophy going all the way back, once again, to philosophers like Plato. Plato's concept of the soul was that it was the immortal part of you that is distinct from your body. It was as if it were the "real you" trapped in a body. Upon death, the soul leaves the body and carries on in existence.

This stands in stark contrast to the Hebrew concept for soul found in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for soul is *nephesh*. We can get a pretty clear picture of the meaning of this word by looking at the first few occurrences of this word found in the creation account in Genesis 2.

The first three appearances of this word are not even in reference to human beings. The souls referred to here are living creatures that are in the water, on the land, and in the sky. In other words they are fish, cattle, and birds. This word is used to describe the complete creature.

When we reach the creation of Adam (a human being), we read:

   [Gen 2:7 KJV] 7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

In other words, when God combined the body formed from dust with the breath or spirit He breathed into Adam, the result was a living creature or a living soul.

One challenge with the word soul is the fact that it can be used figuratively. Even though soul includes the entire living creature, it can be used figuratively to refer to only parts of the creature. For example, you will come across passages in Scripture that speak of a soul rejoicing or soul being troubled. This would be a figurative use of the word soul, where the word for the whole person is used to represent an internal emotion or feeling. But eventually, most things that are buried deep inside usually have a way of affecting the entire person.

So loving God with all of your soul doesn't mean loving Him with some piece of you that is inside your body but separate from your body. It means loving God with the entire creature that He has made you to be. It is actually all encompassing.

The Heart
---------

When we think of this word, its natural to imagine a bodily organ that pumps blood. But the Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab*, which are translated *heart* in the Old Testament, literally mean the innermost part of something. These words used in such phrases as "the *heart* of the sea" or the "the *midst* of heaven".

When heart is spoken of in the human context, it represents the innermost part or central part of your soul. Life is described, in Proverbs 4:23, as flowing out of the heart:

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.

The heart is like the fountain your life flows out of. It drives the very activities and actions of life.

This understanding of the heart as the source of the activity of the soul is found throughout the teaching of Christ. In a great moment of teaching, the Pharasees come to Christ and ask Him why he didn't wash His hands before eating as was their tradition. Christ has a marvelous way of taking such a surface-level question and turning it around to teach something much deeper.

   [Mat 15:17-20 KJV] 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

The Pharasees were worrying about being made unclean by dirty hands. That was only a surface level cleanness. It was their heart that was really making them unclean. And no amount of washing in water would cleanse that part of them.

In the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, Christ zeros in on the heart in a series of alternating contrasts between the letter of the law and the Spirit of God that was behind the law. He says, in effect:

   You have heard it said: don't murder. This is the letter of the law. But I say unto you: anyone who is angry without cause has committed murder in his heart. This is the Spirit behind the law.

   You have heard it said: don't commit adultery. This is the letter of the law. But I say unto you: anyone who lusts has committed adultery in his heart. This is the Spirit behind the law.

The Pharisees, in their attempt to not break the letter of law of God, added layer upon layer of protection around the law until it became almost unrecognizable. But none of this dealt with the source of the problem, the heart. The fact that so many layers were required to achieve a form out outward conformance is actually a testament to just how bad the heart problem was. Christ came to deal with the problem at its source. If the problem is deal with at the source, fulfilling the letter of the law will be a natural outcome.

Any works that are acceptable to God and will stand the test always flow out of a heart that is led by His Word. This is what Christ is getting at in the parable of the wise and foolish builders.

   [Luk 6:45-49 KJV] 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. 46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

Who is the rock in this parable? It is the Word of God. But more importantly, where is the rock? The wise builder dug deep and laid a foundation. This was no mere surface encounter with the Word. This was an encounter with the Word at the deepest level. The rock is the heart filled and led by the Word of God. This is what serving God is all about.

A Man After God's Own Heart
===========================

When we looked at the words heart and soul, we saw that in the Hebrew Old Testament, the book of Psalms had more references to *heart* than any other book. It's not entirely surprising that David, "a man after God's own heart" (1 Sam 13:14, Acts 13:22), would write a lot about the heart. What can we lean about the heart from David?

David actually make some pretty bad mistakes during his life. He first committed adultery and then saw to it that the husband of the woman he slept with was killed in battle. This sin didn't just take place in his heart, it carried right through to the external action. How could someone like this be said to have a heart "after God's own heart?" The answer to this lies in David's response to his sin.

Psalm 51 records David's response to God after the prophet Nathan came to him to confront him about his sin:

   [Psa 51:2-4, 6, 10, 16-17 KJV] 2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. ... 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ... 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ... 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

When the sinful heart encounters the Word of God, there really are only two options: that heart can be blinded and hardened through resistance or that heart can be broken. David's encounter with the truth of his failure resulted in a broken spirit and a broken heart.

David knew that what God was really after in the law wasn't burnt offerings and sacrifices. Yes, those were part of serving God under the law, but the actual objective of the law was to bring about an awareness of sin that leads to a broken and a contrite heart. This is something God will never despise.

The cry of David's heart in Psalm 51 is answered 1000 years later in the Son of David. At the start of His earthly ministry, Christ went into a synagogue one sabbath, opened the book of Isaiah, and read this:

   [Isa 61:1-2 KJV] 1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD.

Christ is saying to Israel: for those of you that have had your heart broken by the law, I am here for you. For those of you that are in bondage , I will set you free. I am here so you can become what God has always wanted you to be.

God's wanted Israel to be a light and an example to all other nations on earth. Israel was to be a living, breathing, walking, talking example of what God's heart looked like. They were to educate and to teach the world about Him.

The ministry of Christ wasn't about healing the sick and feeding the hungry. Yes, those were signs that He did, but these signs were given to prove that He was the one who could truly heal the heart and feed the soul. For that to be possible, you had to be open to Him, like David was. A broken heart is a heart open to Him.

Unfortunately, not many in the nation Israel had a heart like David's. Instead of being broken, they became blinded and hardened. Book of Acts is the story of God trying to reach the hard heart of Israel who had rejected their own Messiah. The book of Acts ends with Israel in blindness. Not blindness for ever, but blindness until one day God prepares their hearts to look upon the one they have pierced and mourn. Blindness until one day they have a heart like the heart of David.

The Greatest Prayer
===================

Has the blindness and hardness of the heart of Israel prevented God from moving forward in His purposes? Late in his ministry, the Apostle Paul sheds some light on this in the book of Ephesians.

   [Eph 3:8-11 KJV] 8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 9 And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

Throughout the book of Acts, Paul was focused on reaching the heart of one nation, the nation of Israel. Even when he was working with other nations, he was doing it as a way to ultimately reach the heart of Israel. 

What Paul is talking about here is specifically reaching the heart of all nations together without distinction. This purpose wasn't an afterthought of God in response to the blindness of Israel. This was always His purpose from the beginning, but it was a hidden purpose. In His wisdom, God used the blindness of Israel as a way to bring this purpose to the forefront.

What does Paul want everyone to see? He is speaking of the Fellowship of the Mystery. What is this fellowship? I believe the answer to this lies in the Paul that Paul immediately goes on to pray:

   [Eph 3:14-19 NKJV] 14 For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height-- 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

The word fellowship is the Greek word *koinonia*. This is the same word used in the book of Corinthians for communion. The Jewish believer came together to remember the body and blood of the Lord. Was this communion about the closeness of these believers fellowshipping with each other? I think it led to that, but it was fundamentally about fellowship and closeness with Christ.

What Paul is praying for us to see here is the communion of the Mystery. This is about constant communion with God through Christ dwelling in our hearts. There is something special here that is at a level that God had never before revealed. This isn't about knowing about the love of Christ with our mind, this is knowing the love of Christ in our heart at such a level that we want the same things He wants. Remembering him isn't something we come together to do around a meal. Our very lives can be constant communion with God if he fills every aspect.

This fellowship isn't about the law of God being written in the heart of one nation, this is about Christ dwelling in the hearts of all nations. This isn't about one nation being an example to teach the other nations of the earth. This is about all nations together being an example and teaching the heavenly rulers and authorities about the wisdom of God.

If we lose sight of the heart of the fellowship of the mystery, the traps of the Pharisee, the Sadducee, and the Scribe don't lie very far away. True Bible study is getting to know God at such a level that He fills our hearts with the love of Christ. If we understand The Mystery and don't have love, we really are nothing, because the entire point of the Mystery is the love. If we could ask God only one thing, it would be this. This is a prayer that when spoken from a broken heart won't go unanswered.
