One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to walk up to God manifested in the flesh on the earth and ask Him one question, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzling or challenging passage in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something like this at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel actually had this very opportunity. Now I don't think that, from their perspective, they looked at it this way. In fact, these leaders saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he had repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy.

They wanted to act forcefully against Him, but they were afraid the people. So they devised a strategy: trying to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could ask Him hard questions and get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, then they would have him in their trap.

Looking back on this from our perspective, this is actually a pretty ironic or even comic scene. The person they are about to question is the "Word of God made flesh" (John 1:14). The Word of God made flesh: sharper than a two-edge sword, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Heb 4:12). It just strikes me that trying to trick somebody like that is a bad idea.

What's amazing about this scene recorded in Mark 12 is how Jesus takes something that was intended as a trap and uses it for powerful teaching in a way that I had never considered before.


The Pharisees & Herodians
-------------------------

The first question came from a group that was actually formed of two different sects, the Pharisees and the Herodians. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. They ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that the law.

The Herodians where a group distinct from the Pharisees and Sadducees that most scholars believe were very friendly to Herod the Great. In other words, they were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of Herod as King. They would have normally been at odds with the Pharisees over political differences, but they united with them in their attempt to trap Jesus.

They first attempt to butter up and flatter Jesus, and then they get around to asking their question:

   [Mar 12:14-15 KJV] 14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].

To understand where this question is coming from, we need to appreciate how the Pharisees approached tithing. Under the law of Moses, each tribe of Israel other than the tribe of Levi was required to pay ten percent to help support the tribe of Priests in their service of the nation. In other words, this was a divinely-instituted tax system.

The Pharisees made tithing much more than this: they would give a tenth of their mint, of their dill, of their spices, and so on. They became obsessed with giving a tenth of everything. They built an elaborate system around this. They stared to think that worshiping God was about tithing.

When they ask whether it's *lawful* to pay tax, they aren't referring to the law of Rome, they are referring to the law of Moses. In other words, they were asking "does the Law of God require us to pay our taxes". They framed this question expecting a simple "yes" or "no" answer, knowing they had laid the trap.

But of course, Christ saw through this and gave them an extremely insightful answer:

   [Mar 12:16-17 KJV] 16 And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

At a surface level, it would be easy to look at this answer and think that Christ simply avoided the trap and told the Pharisees to keep giving their tithes and keep paying their taxes. But I believe the Word of God is sharper than that and cuts deeper than that.

Christ knew what was going on in their heart, and this is what I believe he was discerning about them: "you may be tithing ten percent of everything you have, but you've actually given nothing to God. You may be paying your taxes, but deep down you hate doing it, and you are no different than someone who doesn't pay their taxes". Or put another way "if you truly gave God what He wanted, you wouldn't have so much trouble giving Caesar some tax money that has his face stamped on it."

So, really, it all comes down to the question of "what does God want"? We'll get to the answer, but we have to work our way through the next two questions.

The Sadducee
------------

The next question came from a Sadducee. The Sadducees were a religious sect that were opposed to all the added traditions of the Pharisees that weren't found in the Torah. They believed strongly that the written Word was the only authoritative source for doctrine. They also happened to deny the truth of resurrection. This, and other disagreements, put them at odds with the Pharisees. Sp they were probably glad to see the Pharisees put in their place with the first question.

The Sadducee came to Jesus with a hypothetical question about the doctrine of resurrection that involved seven brothers that had each married, and then died soon thereafter. The catch here was that they all married the same woman in succession:

   [Mar 12:23-24 KJV] 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

How could resurrection ever take place, they were thinking, if you have a scenereo like this. Of course, Christ knew there was no real problem here and pointed out the source of their difficulty:

   [Mar 12:24-25 KJV] 24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

Had they truly known the Scriptures and the power of God, they would have never even had the hypothetical difficulity.

The Scribe
----------

Finally, seeing how well Jesus had answered the Sadducee, a Scribe decided to ask a skill testing question. The Scribes were the keepers and teachers of the Law. They liked to sort, categorize, organize, and study the commandments. Perhaps they even got into debates over which commandments were most important.


   [Insert Scribes question]

Christ answers this simply and directly with insight that actually applies to all three questions:

   [Mar 12:29-31 KJV] 29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment. 31 And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

I believe this is actually the answer all three needed to hear. It's one thing to read, teach, and debate the Words of God. But its an entirely different thing to understand and want the heart of God that is behind those words. For your heart to be on the same page as God's heart. That's a totally different experience.

All three of these leaders had access to the same Words of God. But for them, it seems it was more about the words than the heart. The Pharisees added to the Word. The Saducees took away from the Word. The Scribes spent time trying to organize, categorize, and rank the Words.

Out of the three, it seems that the Scribe is touched in some way by Christ's answer

   [Insert Christ's answer here]


The Greatest Commandment
========================

The greatest commandment is about *love*: first and foremost loving God, and then loving other people. And they are related: loving God leads to loving other people. This love is not a feeling or emotion, it is service and sacrifice. The word for *love* is the same word used in John 3:16 "for God so *loved* the word that He *gave*". So loving with the heart, soul, mind, and strength is serving Him with the heart, soul, mind, and strength.

Heart & Soul
------------

It turns out that heart and soul are actually the real key words to understanding the greatest commandment. And they are, in fact, closely related. To see this, we need to go back to the passage in Deuteronomy that Christ was quoting in Mark:

   [Deu 6:4-6 NKJV] 4 "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD [is] one! 5 "You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. 6 "And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.

Which word is missing here that was present in Mark? *Heart* and *soul* and *strength* (or might) are all present. But the word *mind* is absent. Why is this significant?

We must keep in mind that Deuteronomy was written long before Mark, and it was written from a Hebrew perspective. The people that Jesus was addressing in Mark were living in a culture that had been influenced by Greek philosophers like Plato for hundreds of years. And to Plato, the mind was a big deal. In fact, he believed that one could arrive at ultimate or absolute truth through use of the mind or the intellect. The mind was so elevated that it had practically become a god. The mind was viewed as a central part of the immortal soul.

But all of this is contrary to a true Scriptural understanding of the mind. Scripture teaches that the heart is the deepest part of the person. And it is actually the heart that steers the rational mind. In Romans chapter 1, Paul describes the sad path of nations that resisted the truth of God and went after idols. It started when those nations failed to glorify God as God (Rom 1:21). This resulted in their foolish heart being darkened. Finally, God gave them over to a reprobate mind that led to all sorts of activities not in line with the heart of God (Rom 1:28). Not glorifying God led to a darkened heart which led to a reprobate mind. The heart actually steered the mind off course.

Christ acknowledges the importance of the rational mind as part of a complete person, but I don't believe it was the major focus of his teaching. You can see this quite easily by looking at how many times he actually uses the word. Just looking at the words spoken by Christ in the book of Mark uncovers the following:

- Heart: 8x
- Soul: 8x
- Mind: 1x (only in the quotation from Deut)

It's fair to say that Christ focused on the heart and soul in His teaching. He speaks about them 8 times more frequently than the mind throughout the book of Mark.

Looking back at the book of Deuteronomy, it turns out it's filled with references to the heart. In fact, out of all the books in the Old Testament, it's one of the top books about the heart with 49 references to 'heart' (the book of Psalms does beat it out with 133 reference). Imagine that, a book of Moses that's a book on the heart.

Out of those 49 references to heart in Deuteronomy, ten of them are actually the phrase "heart and soul." This is very fitting seeing that there are ten commandments. And the whole law can be summed up by loving God with all of your heart and your soul.

TODO: See might or strength really as an amplifier, not so much as a distinct thing to talk about. It is how you love God with heart & soul.

The Soul
--------

The challenge in understanding the word *soul* is that fact that the common meaning of this word is colored heavily by Greek philosophy going all the way back, once again, to philosophers like Plato. Plato's concept of the soul was that it was the immortal part of you that is distinct from your body. It was as if it were the "real you" trapped in a body. Upon death, the soul leaves the body and carries on in existence.

This stands in stark contrast to the Hebrew concept for soul found in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for soul is *nephesh*. We can get a pretty clear picture of the meaning of this word by looking at the first few occurrences of this word found in the creation account in Genesis. Interestingly enough, the first three appearances of this word are not even in reference to human beings:

   21 And God created great whales, and every living creature[H5315] that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
   
   24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature[H5315] after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
   
   30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life,[H5315] [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

The souls referred to here are living creatures that are in the water, on the land, and in the sky. In other words they are fish, cattle, and birds. This word is used to describe the complete creature, and it is definitely not limited to humans.

When we reach the creation of Adam (a human being), we read:

   7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.[H5315]

In other words, when God combined the body formed from dust with the breath or spirit He breathed into Adam, the result was a living creature or a living soul.

One challenge with the word soul is the fact that it can be used figuratively. Even though soul includes the entire living creature, it can be used figuratively to refer to only parts of the creature. For example, you will come across passages in Scripture that speak of a soul rejoicing or soul being troubled. This would be a figurative use of the word soul, where the word for the whole person is used to represent an internal emotion or feeling. But eventually, most things that are buried deep inside usually have a way of affecting the entire person.

So loving God with all of your soul doesn't mean loving Him with some piece of you that is inside your body but separate from your body. It means loving God with the entire creature that He has made you to be. It is actually all encompassing.

The Heart
---------

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   Christ taught that the heart is the source out from which everything flows. A heart that is filled with the spirit of Christ is like building on the rock. The works will weather the storm. If you want to serve God, it must be from the heart.

When we think of this word, its natural for us to imagine a bodily organ that pumps blood. But the Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab*, which are translated *heart* in the Old Testament, literally mean the innermost part of something.  you will see these words used in such phrases as "the *heart* of the sea" or the "the *midst* of heaven".

When *leb* or *lebab* are spoken of in the human context, the *heart* represents the innermost part or central part of your soul. Life is described, in Proverbs 4:23, as flowing out of the heart:

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.

Another way to say this is that the heart is like the fountain of life in a person, the place out from which the activities and actions of life flow.

This understanding of the heart as the source of the activity of the soul is found throughout the teaching of Jesus. At one point the Pharasees were giving Him a hard time for not washing His hands before eating as was their custom. [Consider bringing in the brief question and His answer].

Christ has a marvelous way of taking a question or situation that is really superficial and turning it around to teach something much deeper. His teaching to the Pharisees can be found in Mat 15:17-20:

   "Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are [the things] which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
   
In the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, Christ zeros in on the heart in a series of alternating contrasts between the letter of the law and the heart desire of God that was behind the law:

- You have heard it said, "don't murder". This is the domain of the law. The external action.
- But I say unto you: anyone who is angry without cause will be treated as if they had murdered.

- You have heard it said: "don't commit adultery".
- But I say unto you: anyone who lusts has committed adultery in their heart.

The Pharisees, in their attempt to not break the letter of law of God, added layer upon layer of protection around the law until it became almost unrecognizable. But none of this dealt with the source of the problem, the heart. The fact that so many layers were required to achieve a form out outward conformance is actually a testament to just how bad the heart problem was. Christ came to deal with the problem at its source. If the problem is deal with here, the law will be fulfilled as a natural outcome.

Any true service or worship rendered to God must flow out from the heart.
Luke 6:43-49: the parable of the wise and foolish builder. Who is the rock? Christ (or His Spirit) Where is the rock? (In your heart). This is what serving God and pleasing God is all about.

The ministry that Christ had with Israel was actually a heart-focused ministry. That's why it looked so radically different from the religion and the reason of the day. The great miracles He did were all secondary to this. The signs that Christ did were to confirm the promises given in the prophets. He didn't come to set aside the law, He came to deal with the problem at the source. Only then can the law can be truly fulfilled. Not as a way to become righteous, but because of righteousness. 

A Man After God's Own Heart
===========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   David, despite his many failure, was seeking God from the heart. He didn't run from the conviction of sin, he embraced it. His heart was broken, not hardened. He desired what only God can give, a clean heart filled with His spirit.

When we looked at the words heart and soul, we saw that in the Hebrew Old Testament, the book of Psalms had more references to *heart* than any other book. It's not entirely surprising that "a man after God's own heart" (as David is known in Acts 13:22) would write a lot about the heart. What can we lean about the heart from David?

First of all, David actually committed some pretty big sins. He committed adultery and then murder in an attempt to cover it up. How could someone like this be said to have a heart "after God's own heart." David had many failures, but I believe the answer to this lies in how he responded when he was confronted with his sin.

Psalm 51 is David's response after being confronted with his serious sin.

   [Psa 51:2-4, 6, 10, 16-17 KJV] 2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. ... 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. ... 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. ... 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

David's encounter with the truth of his failure led to a broken spirit and a broken heart. David knew that what God was really after wasn't the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.

When David acknowledged his sin, he didn't just go make a burnt offering to God. He acknowledged the source of the problem. This is something God does not despise.

Old Covenant: The Law was an encounter with the Word of God. More than burnt offerings and sacrifices, the Lord desired a broken heart and a broken spirit. In fact, this was the intended outcome of the Law.

David asked for something that only God could provide. What David is asking for can only be answered in Christ:

   [Isa 61:1 KJV] 1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound;

This is how Christ described His own ministry. His ministry was to those who were the brokenhearted under the Old Covenant. The cry of David's heart was answered in the Son of David, Jesus Christ. A broken heart is an open heart. Psalm 129:23 - "Search me and know my heart". David is saying, God my heart is open to you.

New Covenant: The very best the Law could do is "break your heart". But, thankfully, Christ came for those with a broken heart. That's what His ministry was all about. When God puts His Spirit and His Law into the hearts of the New Covenant people, Israel will be the nation that God always wanted. All the other nations of the world will take notice of this incredible nation.

Deut 30:6 looks forward to the New Covenant. The cutting here is not in the flesh but in the heart. This is the only way to truly love God with all your heart and soul. The circumcision of the flesh was part of the law. But the cutting of the heart was what God was really after. I believe that "circumcision of the heart" was the real theme of the ministry of Christ while He was on earth. His teaching and ministry was focused on the heart because everything else flows out from there.
The only alternative outcome was a blinded, hardened heart that wasn't touched by God. Only two responses are possible to the Law: being broken or being blinded.

Unfortunately for the nation of Israel, not many had a heart like David's. They had opportunities to repent time and again. God was incredibly patient with them. But most of Israel had the opposite of a broken heart: a hardened heart. The only way the nation of Israel will fulfill the purpose God has for them is through a broken heart, not a hard heart. Christ told the Pharisees that if they would have believed Moses they would have believed Him. In other words, they really didn't get what the law was about.


The Greatest Prayer
===================

.. sidebar:: Main Point

   Relationship with God has always been about the heart and it is today more than ever.

   Our hearts must be opened and filled in order for us to fulfill the purpose that God has for us. Asking Him to fill our open hearts really is the greatest thing we can pray for.

Let's stop for a moment and ask a question. What does God really want? Why would God so patiently work with one nation for thousands of years despite their blindness and hard heart? What was He trying to accomplish in all of this?

God wanted Israel was to be a light and an example to all other nations. Israel would be a living, breathing, walking, talking example of what God's heart looked like. God was going to use them to educate and teach the world, both through actions and words. 

But even though Israel failed in many ways due to the blindness of their heart, has God stopped teaching the nations with their example? Just look at what we have been learning through their example. If he can do this through failure, just imagine what He will be able to do when, one day, He puts a new heart and a new spirit in that nation. What will that look like?

Let's go back to our question: What does God really want?

Does God only work with one nation? Of course not. God's work with Israel was just one piece of a much bigger puzzle.  The only reason Israel was above all other nations was to serve and teach. If you want to be first, you need to become the servant of all.  God is and is planning to use Israel to minister to the world.

But God is going to accomplish something similar but even bigger with all nations together without distinction when Christ is dwelling in their hearts. The heavenly rulers will look at a body formed from all nations with Christ as head and see the wisdom of God.

Three things:

1. Working on a purpose that involves all nations together without distinction.
2. God is using these nations together to be an example and to teach.
3. It all starts with the heart.

Nations together:

   [Eph 3:6 KJV] 6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

Example to heavenly rulers:

   [Eph 3:8-11 KJV] 8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 9 And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

This is how its going to happen:

   [Eph 3:14-19 NKJV] 14 For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height-- 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.


The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices).

God is calling people out of all nations to be a living, breathing, walking, talking example of what God's heart looks like.

If we lose sight of this, we can end up adding to what God has said, or taking away from what He has said, or just organizing, soring, and raking what He has said. True Bible study isn't about any of those things. True Bible study is letting God fill our hearts and getting to know Him. In Corinthians, Paul says "If I understand all mysteries but don't have love, I am nothing".

It's not what we do. It's not even how we do it. Really, it's why we do what we do. That's really getting to the heart of the matter. Christ dwelling in your heart is the best life and biggest witness you can possibly have.
