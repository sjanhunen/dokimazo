One Question
============

If you could have been around Jesus when He was on the earth and had the opportunity to ask Him one question, what would it be?

Example from Mark 12. Three questions asked.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

- Terms heart, soul, mind, strength in Mark and Deut
- Heart & soul versus mind & body
- Knowledge vs acknowledge
- Hebrew vs Greek thought: "I think therefore I am" 

Israel's First Three Kings
==========================

Illustrations from the lives of Saul, David, Solomon

Saul - outward approval
David - man after God's own heart
Solomon - incredible wisdom

The Greatest Prayer
===================

Q: Is the central prayer in Ephesians the only prayer that specificaly talks about Christ dwelling in our hearts?

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- The context of "The Mystery" and Acts + temple changes (which side of the line?)
- Doing everything heartily
