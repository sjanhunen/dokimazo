One Question
============

If you had the opportunity to meet God face to face and ask for one thing, what would it be? Would it be a special request? An answer to a puzzle in the Bible? I'm sure we've all thought of something at one time or another.

During Christ's earthly ministry, three religious leaders from the nation of Israel unknowingly each had this very opportunity. This encounter recorded in Mark 12 develops into an ironic scene when we look back upon it with a full understanding of who Jesus is and what His message was about.

The leaders of the time saw Jesus as an up and coming threat. His teaching was powerful in a way that theirs wasn't. He was gaining popularity with the people. And he repeatedly called them out for their hypocrisy. They wanted to act forcefully against Jesus, but they feared the people. So they devised a different strategy: they decided to try to trap Jesus using His own words. If they could get Him to say something outrageous or blasphemous, they could use this to finally act against Him.

These guys had gotten so disoriented and distorted in their perception of reality that they were about to try to trap the very God (manifested in human form) that they thought they were serving. They really had no idea what they were walking into. They are about to encounter the Truth.

   In order for you to be able to truly give something to God, not only do you have to know His word and His power, you have to love Him with all of your heart, and mind, and soul, and strength.


The Pharisee
------------

The first question came from a group formed of two different sects, the Pharisees and the Herodians. The Pharisees were a highly religious sect so zealous about keeping the law that they wrapped layer upon layer of tradition around to it in their attempt to avoid breaking it. Where they ended up was so far removed from the heart of God that they were just serving themselves.

The Herodians where a group distinct from the Pharisees and Sadducees that most scholars believe were very friendly to Herod the Great. In other words, they were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of Herod as King. They would have normally been at odds with the Pharisees over this political difference, but they united in their attempt to trap Jesus.

The question they ask was simple: "is it lawful to pay tribue to Caesar?"

Is it lawful would be a reference to Mosaic law.

I think the Pharisee was anticipating a simple "yes" or "no" answer to this question. Christ answered neither.

Christ proposes two "renderings" in His answer. The reality is that they really weren't doing either. Rendering to God the things that are Gods isn't primarily about coins. I believe Christ was talking about the intent of the heart.

The Pharisee was religiously tithing ten percent of everything he owned. But was he actually giving anything to God?

The Sadducee
------------

Next up was the question from the Sadducee. This question centered around the doctrine of resurrection.

The Scribe
----------

The Scribe's question was about the law.

Christ acknowledges that this was a good question. In His answer, Christ points out that everything in fact all the law and the prophets hang on loving God with all the heart, mind, soul, and strength.

This was the only One to walk the face of the earth that actually kept the greatest commandment.

The Greatest Commandment
========================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - The focal point of the ministry of Jesus was the heart for it is the source out from which everything flows
   - True faith (as opposed to religion or reason) is always from the heart

If we are going to truly appreciate the greatest commandment, we need to understand the words used. What are the key words? Christ said we are to love God with all of our "heart", "soul", "mind", and "strength".

First and foremost, there is the word love. This is the word `agape`, the word that is used to describe God's sacrificial, giving love. The love that led the Father to give His only begotten Son for the world. So when we love God, we give our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength to Him.

An important thing to keep in mind is the fact that when Christ uses these words, He's actually quoting from the Old Testament. The parallel passage is found in Deut 6:5

   And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

The phrase "heart and soul" is used numerous times throughout Deut. It really suggests that those two words really were used to describe the complete person.

If we are going to truly appreciate the greatest commandment, we need to understand the words used. What are the key words? We are to love God with all of our "heart", "soul", "mind", and "strength". An important thing to keep in mind is the fact that when Christ uses these words, He's actually quoting from the Old Testament. The parallel passage is found in Deut 4.

It's significant that "heart" and "soul" are two of the three words used in Deuteronomy, because they can be easily misunderstood. Mainstream use today is almost backwards from the Hebrew view of these.

When Christ quotes Deut to the Scribe, he adds a word that isn't present in the Hebrew. Specifically, he adds the word "mind".

The heart is closely linked to what we focus on. Must explore this in more depth. If Christ isn't center, the only alternative is self.

  - What we focus on is where our treasure is
  - What we talk about flows directly out of our heart


Main Passages:
- Matt 6
- Matt 12:34

This relationship between heart (where your treasure is) and mouth (what flows out of that) is clearly seen in passages that speak of salvation. For example, Paul says in Romans 10

    9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
    10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

This is a direct answer to honoring God with your lips but having your heart very far from Him (Isa 29:13). Christ quotes this in Matthew. Theory: The ministry Christ had with Israel was actually a heart-focused ministry. That's why it looked so radically different than the religion and the reason of the day. It was so different, it was unrecognizable to many people. The signs that Christ did were to confirm the promises given in the prophets, but His real work was focused on the heart.

Belief with the heart is truly different from reasoning with the mind  or from participating in religion. Both religion and reason easily become avenues for the elevation of the creature above the creator. Faith acknowledges God as God.

Paul shares the barriers to faith that the Jews and Greeks had at the time. Without faith, the cross appeared to be a symbol of weakness to the Jew. And to the Greek it was foolishness; it didn't make sense.

But with faith, the cross is seen as the power of God (the greatest sign) and the wisdom of God.

The ministry of Christ was really about the heart of Israel. He was the mediator of the New Covenant and His goal was to prepare them for this role.

David: A Man After God's Own Heart
==================================

David stands out among the first 3 kings of Israel. He is the only one described as being a man after God's own heart. What can we learn from his life?

Where was his treasure? What did he talk about in his prayers?

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - David's focus on God's heart kept him on track despite many failures
   - Saul had a focus on the external that led him down the road of jealously and hatred
   - Solomon's pursuit of wisdom led him astray in some ways


The Greatest Prayer
===================

.. sidebar:: Main Points

   - Christ dwelling in our hearts is the single most important thing we can ask for
   - God reveals mysteries to us so we can understand His heart, not so we can explain complex Bible passages
   - Christ's obedience to the Father was the wisdom and power of God. He wanted what God wanted.
   - Doing everything heartily means doing it from the heart!

Compare the covenants to the Mystery. The Mystery is really about an even bigger purpose than any covenant. Think about what is said about the heart in both. Which is more? Which is greater? Who is being witnessed to with the Mystery versus Israel's role as priests?

Is the central prayer in Ephesians the only prayer that specifically talks about Christ dwelling in our hearts?

- Paul's prayer: heart, love of Christ, knowledge that exceeds knowledge
- The one thing that Paul felt was most important to pray about
- The one and best thing we can ask for is Christ dwelling in our hearts. Isn't this infinitely better than everything else? But we tend to grasp after knowledge instead of this.
- The one act of Christ's ministry: wanting exactly what the Father wanted. This was more than the suffering of the Cross itself (think back to more than burnt offerings and sacrifices)
- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
- Paul isn't praying for academic wisdom as he is praying for a heart after God.
