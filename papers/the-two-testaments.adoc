= The Two Testaments

Question: how do we divide or structure the Bible at the most basic level?

== Thesis

The Bible is the life story of the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah that was, and is, and is to come.
Rather than basing our structure of the Bible solely on historical timelines and languages, we should seek to develop a structure based on the major arcs in the life and work of Christ.

The story of God's interaction with humans through Christ is heavily based on metaphor.
Key metaphorical terms used are:

- Will
- Marriage
- Husband
- Wife
- Child
- Heir

The asumption is that these are used consistently throughout the Book.
When we have a correct understanding, these terms will not result in inconsistencies or contradictions.
