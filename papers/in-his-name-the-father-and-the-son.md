In His Name: The Father and the Son
===================================

During His earthly ministry, Jesus faced numerous challenges to His authority from the Jewish religious leaders of the time. The people listening to His teaching realized there was something different about Him. His words had [authority][8] that was not present when the scribes taught. His works confirmed this with [manifestations of power][9]. No doubt the religious leaders were realizing this and beginning to get concerned about what this might mean for thier own positions. The tension is brought to a climax as Jesus teaches in the temple and is confronted by the leaders. The [scene unfolds][1] in Matthew 21:

> Leaders: Who gave you the authority to do this?

> Jesus: I have a question for you first. If you can answer it, I will answer yours.

> Leaders (thinking silently): Where is he going with this?

> Jesus: Who gave John the authority to baptize? Was it God or man?

> Leaders (whispering amongst themselves): If we say God, he will ask us why we didn't listen to John. If we say man, the people will be angry with us since everybody believes he was sent by God.

> Leaders (to Jesus): We cannot answer your question.

> Jesus: I won't answer your question either.

Just before this encounter, Jesus had entered the temple and purged it of the moneychangers. He was, as we might say, "cleaning house", because it had become something so very different from a house of prayer. He healed the blind and lame that came to Him in the Temple. The people saw this and praised God, but the chief priests and scribes resented it. Jesus was in the very building where these leaders would have commanded the most authority and respect, and yet, He was the one with authority. No doubt, their outrage was also mixed with genuine curiosity. How did this man, who seemed to come out of nowhere, just show up and take control? He walked into the Temple as if it were His own.

Jesus does not answer the question except by asking another in return. He points these leaders at the ministry of John the baptist. Had they listened to Him, they would have had no need to ask this question. John was a [witness][10] for  the truth about who Jesus was. To find an answer to the question in the words of Jesus, we need to review an incident that took place outside the Temple on one of His [earlier visits][2] to Jerusalem, as recorded in John 5.

Beside the pool Bethesda, Jesus finds a lame man and commands him to get up, take his bed mat, and walk. The catch: this healing took place on the Sabbath. The Jews heard of this and promptly accused Jesus of breaking the Law of the Sabbath - first, by [healing on the Sabbath][5], and second, by commanding him to [carry his mat on the Sabbath][6].

When confronted about this, Jesus doesn't enter into a discourse on the law or the sabbath. Instead, He simply speaks about His relationship with His father.

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

He makes clear the link to His Father and in doing so identifies Himself as the Son of God. If His "breaking of the Sabbath" were enough to anger these Jews, calling God His father takes things to a whole new level.

But Jesus goes on to identify the source of all He did and the authority He held.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [John 5:19-20 ESV]

How tempting it is to think that Jesus, being God in flesh, had no need to learn from anyone or answer to anyone. But here we see that this is not the case. As a faithful servant and son, He learned everything from His Father. He did nothing that was outside of His Father's plan. First and foremost, He did not take authority upon Himself - he received it from the Father.

> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son ... he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [Jhn 5:22-27 ESV]

The judgment exercised by the Son is always by faith. That is, it is [based on what He hears][7] from the Father. Unlike the judgment of the Jewish leaders, His judgment is always based solidly on the Word of God in alignment with the Will of God.

> I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [Jhn 5:30 ESV]

Now Jesus provides a concise summary of His ministry

> I have come in my Father's name [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

It was the Father that had given Jesus all authority for His ministry and all power to do His works. The Jewish leaders refused to accept this fact. But here we have, in simple terms, the answer to their question.

It is impossible to imagine doing something "in His name" outside of the context of a relationship with Him. Three critical aspects of this relationship are illustrated in the Son's relationship with the Father.

1. Purpose - the Father's calling for the Son
2. Trust - the Son's faith in the Father's Word
3. Obedience - faithfulness to the Father's will

As a faithful Son of His Father, Christ fulfills all three of these in His life. It is the complete and utter faithfulness of Christ to the Word and Will of the Father that makes the exaltation of Christ possible that Paul writes about.

> Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. [Phil 2:9-11 ESV]
