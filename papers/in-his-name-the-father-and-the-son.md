In His Name: The Father and the Son
===================================

A new introduction ...

Beside the pool Bethesda, Jesus finds a lame man and commands him to get up, take his bed mat, and walk. The catch: this healing took place on the Sabbath. The Jews heard of this and promptly accused Jesus of breaking the Law of the Sabbath - first, by [healing on the Sabbath][5], and second, by commanding him to [carry his mat on the Sabbath][6].

When confronted about this, Jesus doesn't enter into a discourse on the law or the sabbath. Instead, He simply speaks about His relationship with His father.

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

He makes clear the link to His Father and in doing so identifies Himself as the Son of God. If His "breaking of the Sabbath" were enough to anger these Jews, calling God His father takes things to a whole new level.

But Jesus goes on to identify the source of all He did and the authority He held.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [John 5:19-20 ESV]

How tempting it is to think that Jesus, being God in flesh, had no need to learn from anyone or answer to anyone. But here we see that this is not the case. As a faithful servant and son, He learned everything from His Father. He did nothing that was outside of His Father's plan. First and foremost, He did not take authority upon Himself - he received it from the Father.

> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son ... he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [Jhn 5:22-27 ESV]

The Son always exercises his judgment by faith. That is, it is [based on what He hears][7] from the Father. Unlike the judgment of the Jewish leaders, His judgment is always based solidly on the Word of God in alignment with the Will of God.

> I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [Jhn 5:30 ESV]

The close relationship between the Father and the Son illustrates three essential aspects of any relationship:

1. Purpose - the Father gave the Son authority to give life and to judge
2. Trust - the Son executed His authority through faith in the Father's Word
3. Faithfulness - the Son lived in perfect obedience to the Father's will

These three - purpose, trust, and faithfulness - are now brought to a concise summary by Jesus.

> I have come in my Father's name [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

For Christ to come in His Father's name meant nothing less than Him fulfilling the purpose the Father had authorized for Him. This was accomplished through complete trust in the Father's word and faithfulness to the Father's will.


TODO: Bring this back to the start nicely.
