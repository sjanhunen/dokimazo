In His Name: The Father and the Son
===================================

The authority of Jesus was questioned by the Jewish religious leaders on multiple occasions. Often, in answer to this, Jesus would respond with [questions of His own][1] or by appealing to the witness of others. But in an encounter recorded in the gospel of John, we find one of the most direct expositions on authority in the words of Christ Himself.

On a journey to Jerusalem, [Jesus finds a lame man][3] by the pool called Bethesda and heals him, commanding him to get up, take his bed mat, and walk. The catch is that this healing took place on the Sabbath. When the Jews heard of this they promptly accused Jesus of breaking the Law of the Sabbath - first, by [healing on the Sabbath][5], and second, by commanding the man to [carry his mat on the Sabbath][6].

When confronted about this, Jesus does not enter into a detailed discourse on the law or the Sabbath. Instead, He simply begins to explain His relationship with His Father.

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

He makes clear the link to His Father and in doing so identifies Himself as the Son of God. If His "breaking of the Sabbath" were enough to anger these Jews, calling God His father takes things to a whole new level.

He goes on to speak in detail of this relationship.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [John 5:19-20 ESV]

How tempting it is to think that Jesus, being God in flesh, had no need to learn from anyone or answer to anyone. Here we see that this is not the case. As a faithful servant and son, He learned everything from His Father. He did nothing that was outside of His Father's plan. First and foremost, He did not take the authority He had for Himself: he received it from the Father.

> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son ... he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [Jhn 5:22-27 ESV]

The Son always exercises his judgment by faith. That is, it is [based on what He hears][7] from the Father. Unlike the judgment of the Jewish leaders, which was often [based on thier traditions][11], His judgment was always based solidly on the Word of God in alignment with the Will of God.

> I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [Jhn 5:30 ESV]

This close relationship between the Father and the Son illustrates three essential aspects of any relationship:

1. Purpose - the Father gave the Son authority to judge
2. Trust - the Son executed His authority through faith in the Father's Word
3. Faithfulness - the Son lived in perfect obedience to the Father's will

All three of these are brought to a concise summary by Jesus Himself.

> I have come in my Father's name [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

These are the words of a faithful servant. For Christ, this meant nothing less than fulfilling the purpose the Father had given to Him.
