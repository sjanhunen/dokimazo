The New Person
==============

Could it be that Eph 1-3 has the theme of the creation of the new person in Christ that is the culmination of God's purpose. Eph 4-6 is specifically outlining our calling as the husband within that new person.


Is anthropology just the study of men?

- Could it be, that the new anthropos spoken of in Ephesians is actually this joined-together body of husband and bride? They are distinct bodies and different callings, but I do believe that God will ultimately in His time, bring His purposes together in Christ.
- Does it not make sense that anthropos includes both the male and the female aspect.
- A new person is formed when husband and bride are brought together.
- When Christ is all in all, can there be any distinction between male or female, Jew or Greek, bond or free. Don't Gal 3:28 and Col 3:11 both find fulfillment here in the new anthropos?
- The Christ (the last Adam) and the old anthropos contrasted in 1 Cor 15:47
- What books in the Bible specifically speak of the "new anthropos"?
- As part of our walk, we are instructed to reflect that we are a part of this new person (Eph 4:22-24)

Ephesians 1-3 is specifically revealing the new person (anthropos) that brings together the purposes of God:

- Eph 1:10: God's plan to unite all things in Him
- Eph 2:14: made both one - God is making one flesh out of two in Christ through the spirit, much like he did with Adam and Eve in the flesh. When these two are combined, it's not one tacked onto the other, but the two together creating something entirely new. In other words, the new anthropos.
- Is "both" in Eph 2 referring primarily to people according to the flesh or to purposes according to calling? Does the difference between Israel and Nations disappear in the restored earth?
- Eph 2:15 shows that God is making one new person (anthropos) in Christ.
- Eph 3:15: of whom every family is named in heaven and earth
- Eph 2:16: what does the "one body" include? The new anthropos? It's possible that body could refer to the husband, to the bride, or to the resulting combination of the two.
- Eph 3:6: The word syssomos only appears in Eph 3:6. What God is creating here is a joint-body, where both have access to the Father by the same spirit. This is a very significant piece of the puzzle. Is the joint body in Ephesians speaking about only the husband, or is the join body actually something new that God creates when he joins the husband and bride in His ultimate purpose of the ages?
- Eph 2:19 - together citizens (only in Ephesians)
- What other joint / together words do we find in Ephesians???
- Look back at Genesis 1:26. Is mankind in this verse anthropos? (see ""One Flesh"--Eph. 5.22-24, 5.31: Marriage and the New Creation")

We find the creation of the new person in Ephesians, much like we find the creation of the old person in Genesis. The word "anthropos" appears 9x throughout Ephesians.

Consider very precisely the creation of Adam and Eve. How might it relate to Christ and the churches?
