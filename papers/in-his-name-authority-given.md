In His Name: Authority
==========================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? How often have you heard a phrase like "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" used without any real though given to its significance? How many things have been done "in the name of God" that really have nothing to do with Him and His purposes?

According to Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament, the word name (onoma in the Greek), can be used in the following ways

1. name: univ. of proper names
2. for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers
3. persons reckoned up by name
4. the cause or reason named: on this account, because he suffers as a Christian, for this reason

Whlie a simple proper name is the most common usage of this word, what we are considering here is definitely more aligned with the second meaning: a figurative use that represents the authority and power behind the name.

The book of Acts contains a number of excellent examples of the phrase "in the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous). Throughout this book, we see the Apostles
- Baptizing in the name of Jesus - Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.

Points for further development:
- Phil 2:10-11 - at the name of Jesus every knee should bow
- John 5:43 - I am come in my Father's name: see all that the Father authorized the Son to do
- John 10:25 - Christ did works in His Father's name
- Mark 1:27 - He commanded the unclean spirits with authority
