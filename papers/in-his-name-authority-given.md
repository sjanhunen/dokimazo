In His Name: Authority
======================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? Perhaps you have concluded your prayers "in Jesus name" without giving much thought to the real meaning behind the phrase. We realize that when something is done or said "in His name", the intention is not merely to include His name like a signature, but to somehow invoke the authority and power of Jesus. In other words, we believe that His name represents His authority.

During His earthly ministry, the Jewish religious leaders were constantly challenging the authority of Jesus.  The people listening to His teaching realized there was something different about Him. His words had authority that was not present when the scribes taught (Matt 7:29). His works displayed a real power. The religious leaders we realizing this and, no doubt, beginning to get concerned about what this might mean for thier own positions.

These leaders finally confront Jesus while teaching in the temple, as recorded in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. A lighthearted pharapharase might go something like this

> Leaders: Who said you could teach in the Temple?
> Jesus: I have a question for you first. If you can answer it, I will answer yours. 
> Leaders (thinking silently): Where is he going with this?
> Jesus: Who gave John the authority to baptize? Was it God or man?
> Leaders (whispering amongst themselves): If we say God, he will ask us why we didn't listen to John. If we say man, the people will be angry with us since everybody believes he was sent by God.
> Leaders (to Jesus): We cannot answer your question.
> Jesus: I won't answer your question either.

*TODO*: confirm the order of these incidents. I suspect the healing (outside the Temple) happened before the teaching (inside the Temple). I believe so: http://www.welcometohosanna.com/LIFE_OF_JESUS/036_Ministry16JourneyToJerusalem.htm. The visit in John would not be the same as the last visit recorded in Matthew. So by the end of His ministry, Jesus had a different strategy in answering these sorts of questions than at the beginning.

Jesus does not directly answer their question: He asks them another question in response. To fully appreciate the line of reasoning Jesus takes here, we have to review an incident earlier in His ministry.

In John 5, on His way into Jerusalem, Jesus heals a lame man beside the pool called Bethesda.

Jesus answers their accusations by speaking about a relationship:

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

John presents Jesus as the Son of God. As a true faithful son, everything He had and did was received from the Father. He never took something that didn't belong to Him.

It's easy to think that since Jesus was God, there was no need for Him to ever receive this authority. But when he came to earth, He humbled himself, He laid aside all of His glory. As we see here, as a true Son of His Father, everything He had was given to Him. He did not assume or take something that didn't belong to Him.


> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

In order to come in the name of the Father, Jesus had a relationship with the Father and was sent by the Father. In this chapter we see that this includes

- The works that He did by the Father (v20)
- Life as the Father has life in Himself (v26)
- Authority to execute judgment (v27)
- Will of the Father, not His own will (v30)

Not only did Jesus come in the name of the Father, representing the Father as the Son, the works He did were done in the name of the Father. The works done in the name of the Father were the credentials of Jesus. He didn't go around listing His credentials to everyone. 

> Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me" (John 10:25 ESV)


Notes for other entries
-----------------------

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

Looking at how the phrase "in the name of Jesus" is used in Acts, we see examples of the disciples doing exactly these things:

- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)


In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.
