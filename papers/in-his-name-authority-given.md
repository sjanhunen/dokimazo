In His Name: Authority Given
============================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? How often have you heard a phrase like "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" used without any real though given to its significance? How many things have been done "in the name of God" that really have nothing to do with Him and His purposes?

According to Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament, the word name (onoma in the Greek), can be used in the following ways

1. name: univ. of proper names
2. for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers
3. persons reckoned up by name
4. the cause or reason named: on this account, because he suffers as a Christian, for this reason

Whlie a simple proper name is the most common usage of this word, what we are considering here is definitely more aligned with the second meaning: a figurative use that represents the authority and power behind the name.

A clear example of this is found in
- Phil 2:10-11 - at the name of Jesus every knee should bow

The Father sent the Son as a witness for Him. Because of this, He was able to say that He came in the name of the Father 

Jhn 5:43 ESV - I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.

Jhn 10:25 ESV - Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,

The Disciples were authorized to be witnesses for Jesus, much in the same was He was a witness for the Father.

The book of Acts contains a number of excellent examples of the phrase "in the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous). Throughout this book, we see the Apostles
- Baptizing in the name of Jesus - Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.

Points for further development:
- John 5:43 - I am come in my Father's name: see all that the Father authorized the Son to do
- John 10:25 - Christ did works in His Father's name
- Mark 1:27 - He commanded the unclean spirits with authority
