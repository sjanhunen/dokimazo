In His Name: Authority
======================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? Perhaps you conclude your prayers "in Jesus name" without giving much thought to the significance of the phrase. We realize that when something is done or said "in His name", the intention is not merely to include His name like a signature, but to somehow invoke the authority and power of Jesus. In other words, His name is used to represent His authority. To fully appreciate what it means to do something in the name or the authority of Christ, we must first understand the authority of Christ Himself. And we must understand how He received this authority.

During His earthly ministry, Jesus faced a challenge to His authority from the Jewish religious leaders of the time. The people listening to His teaching realized there was something different about Him. His words had [authority][http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Mat&c=7&t=ESV#s=936028] that was not present when the scribes taught. His works displayed real power. No doubt the religious leaders were realizing this and beginning to get concerned about what this might mean for thier own positions of authority. This tension is brought to a climax as Jesus teaches in the temple and is confronted by the leaders. As the [scene unfolds][1] we might pharaphrase it something like this:

> Leaders: Who gave you the authority to do this?

> Jesus: I have a question for you first. If you can answer it, I will answer yours.

> Leaders (thinking silently): Where is he going with this?

> Jesus: Who gave John the authority to baptize? Was it God or man?

> Leaders (whispering amongst themselves): If we say God, he will ask us why we didn't listen to John. If we say man, the people will be angry with us since everybody believes he was sent by God.

> Leaders (to Jesus): We cannot answer your question.

> Jesus: I won't answer your question either.

Just before this encounter, Jesus had entered the temple and purged it of the moneychangers. He was, as we might say, "cleaning house", because it had become something so very different from a house of prayer. He healed the blind and lame that came to Him in the Temple. The people saw this and praised God, but the chief priests and scribes resented it. Jesus was in the very building where these leaders would have commanded the most authority and respect, and yet, He was the one with the authority. No doubt, their outrage was also mixed with genuine curiosity. How did this man, who seemed to come out of nowhere, just show up and take control? He walked into the Temple as if it were His own.

Jesus does not directly answer the question about His authority. Instead, He refers to John the baptist and asks a question in return. *He asks them why they didn't believe John, because John testified of Him.* To appreciate the approach taken here, we need to review an incident that took place outside the Temple on one of His [earlier visits][2] to Jerusalem, as recorded in John 5.

Beside the pool Bethesda, Jesus finds a lame man and commands him to get up, take his bed mat, and walk. The catch: this healing took place on the Sabbath. The Jews heard of this and promptly accused Jesus of breaking the Law of the Sabbath - first, by [healing on the Sabbath][5], and second, by commanding him to [carry his mat on the Sabbath][6].

When confronted about this, Jesus doesn't enter into a discourse on the law or the sabbath. Instead, He simply speaks about His relationship with His father.

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

He makes clear the link to His Father and in doing so identifies Himself as the Son of God. If His "breaking of the Sabbath" were enough to anger these Jews, calling God His father takes things to a whole new level.

But Jesus goes on to identify the source of all He did and the authority He held.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [John 5:19-20 ESV]

How tempting it is to think that Jesus, being God in flesh, had no need to learn from anyone or answer to anyone. But here we see that this is not the case. As a faithful servant and son, He learned everything from His Father. He did nothing that was outside of His Father's plan. First and foremost, He did not take authority upon Himself - he received it from the Father.

> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son ... he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [Jhn 5:22-27 ESV]

The irony here is that the Jewish leaders we judging the only One who actually had the authority to judge. They were accusing the author of the law of breaking His own law. Did Christ actually break the Sabbath? Not only did He clearly state during His ministry that [He was not abolishing the Law][3], he spoke words of judgment to the leadears about what they had done to His law.

> ... So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. [Mat 15:6 ESV]

No doubt this little Sabbath scuffle started by the Jews was more about the things that they had [added to the law][4] than about the actual law of God itself.

A critical link in the authority of Jesus as judge is the fact that He always exercises judgment by faith. That is, it is [based on what He hears][7] from the Father. Unlike the judment of the Jewish leaders, His judgment is always based on the Word of God and in alignment with the Will of God.

> I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [Jhn 5:30 ESV]

Now we reach a concise summary of the ministry of Christ while on earth

> I have come in my Father's name [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

It was the Father that had given Jesus the authority for His ministry and the power to do His works. The Jewish leaders refused to accept this fact. But here we have, in simple terms, the answer to their question.

Christ sets the pattern for any works to be truly done "in His name". The authority and power for these works must always be

1. Given by God
2. Exercised by faith
3. In His will

> Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind." [Jhn 9:39 ESV]

Notes for other entries
-----------------------

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”

Looking at how the phrase "in the name of Jesus" is used in Acts, we see examples of the disciples doing exactly these things:

- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

Question: How much of what we do in His name is merely building sand castles that will not last?

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.
