In His Name: Authority
======================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? Perhaps you have concluded your prayers "in Jesus name" without giving much thought to the real meaning behind the phrase. We probably realize that when something is done or said "in His name", the intention is not merely to include His name like a signature on a card, but to somehow invoke the authority and power of Jesus. In other words, we believe that His name represents His authority. Actions performed or words spoken in His name have something backing them that would otherwise be missing. But what is this authority? And how do we know that we can actually claim it?

During His earthly ministry, Jesus faced questions about His authority from the Jewish religious leaders. As recorded in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, while teaching in the temple, the religious leaders asked Him by what authorty He did those things. They realized that there was power behind both His teaching and His works, but they refused to believe this came from God. In all three recorded instances, Jesus answers their questions with another question: "The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?". This question was a trap - TBD!

In the Gospel of John, Jesus has a different encounter with the religious leaders of His day.

This time, He explains the source of His authoritiy:

> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

Coming in His Father's name didn't mean that Jesus just went around announcing that God was His Father or that He was the Messiah. In fact, He often told people to not spread word of this around. In John 5, Jesus explains what it means for Him to have come in His Father's name.

- He was shown the works that He did by the Father (v20)
- He was given life as the Father has life in Himself (v26)
- He was given authority to execute judgment (v27)
- He was seeking the will of the Father, not His own will (v30)
- He was sent by the Father (v37)

The works done in the name of the Father were the credentials of Jesus. He didn't go around listing His credentials to everyone. 


Not only did Jesus come in the name of the Father, representing the Father as the Son, the works He did were done in the name of the Father.

> Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me" (John 10:25 ESV)

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

Looking at how the phrase "in the name of Jesus" is used in Acts, we see examples of the disciples doing exactly these things:

- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)


In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.
