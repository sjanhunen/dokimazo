How is The Bible Relevant Today?
================================

Overview of Argument
*   Relevant: has impact on task in such a way that helps achieve a goal
*   Two questions:
        1) Is the Bible relevant to my life?
        2) Is my life relevant to God's plans?
*   One of the biggest problems today: We've made the Bible relevant to our
    lives through "application", but we have become irrelevant to God's plans.
*   Asking question 1 just leads to attempts to "apply" the Bible to our
    goals, whatever they may be, both good and bad.  This is the wrong
    approach. The Bible is a book about God's goals.  When we understand
    His goals we can align ourselves with them.  Our life can have a real
    impact in God's plan when we do this. If our goals are aligned with
    God's goals, the Bible will become relevant to us in such a way that
    it contributes to the success of the Author's plans.

One definition of relevant

    "Something (A) is relevant to a task (T) if it increases the likelihood of
    accomplishing the goal (G), which is implied by T." (HjÃ¸rland & Sejer
    Christensen,2002) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance]

For Example

                    A (The Bible)
                    |
                    |
                    v
         ---T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-->G (The Goal)
               (The Task)

If what we learn from the Bible changes what we do on a day to day basis in
some way that has an impact on us reaching a certain goal, we can say that the
Bible was relevant to that goal. (Of course the definition was relative to the
task, but the task implies the goal.)

When we ask "Is the Bible relevant?", we have to first ask "what is the 
goal?" Possible goals may be happiness, a successful career, lasting
relationships, a ministry of some kind, etc [this needs work!]. These
are not bad goals. The Bible, if studied in light of these goals, does
seem to offer much applicable advice.  Many people have done many good things
by "applying" the Bible to the realization of thier goals. We can say that
the Bible was "relevant" to these people. It made a difference in their life; it
helped them achieve something.

Let's say someone who isn't even a believer starts following some principles
they read about in the Sermon on the Mount. There are many "good people" that
could fit this description. The Bible has had an impact on their life. They are
doing good things, and maybe it has even helped them achieve some goal. If we
use the strict definition of "relevance", the Bible was "relevant" to their
task/goal.

So where's the rub? The problem is that this misses the entire point of the
Bible.  This book is not a book about our goals. It is a book about God's
goals. To talk about the relevance of the Bible in the truest sense, we must
understand what goals the Author had in mind. Anything less means that
we really don't understand the book. To talk about the relevance of something
we don't understand is really just to pick out some things that we like while
ignoroing the real message.

Let's think about a few types of people and discuss "relevance":
1) A good person who successfully applies some principles found in the Bible to
their goals
2) A person who learns God's goals from the Bible and then applies the Bible to
those

What is God's goal according to the Bible? To answer this, we need to take a
look at the big picture painted by the Book.

Three important illustrations that show God's purpose is always much bigger than those he is trying to reach:

1. God called out one nation (Israel) to be a special nation. This wasn't because they were speical. He did this to reach the rest of the world through them.
2. When Israel was faltering and failing to embrace their purpose, God began reaching out to other nations. This isn't because they were special. This is because God was trying to reach Israel to help them get back to the purpose He originally had for them.
3. God chose to work with all nations that come from Adam as a way to reach or teach the heavenly powers about His wisdom. His biggest and most mysterious purpose includes us in an amazing way, but it is actually about something much bigger than us.
