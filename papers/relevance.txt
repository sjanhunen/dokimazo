How is The Bible Relevant Today?
================================

Plan of Attack
--------------
* The Meaning of Relevant
    * Has impact on achieving a goal
    * Two approaches:
        * Apply the Bible to our goals (what we do when we don't understand)
        * Apply the Bible to God's goals (we must understand the book)
* The Big Picture:
    * Graphical timeline with key events
    * Kingdom of Priests, Overcomers, Bride: God's goal for most of the Bible
    * The Jew was *first*; the Temple had a wall
    * Covenant Relationship
* The Relevant Bible
    * Most of the Bible isn't written about you!
    * No Covenant Relationship
    * The Jew is not first; middle wall broken down (literally)
    * The New Man, the Body of Christ: God's goal today
    * Relevant: not the past, not the future, but today

What is relevant?
-----------------

"Something (A) is relevant to a task (T) if it increases the likelihood of
accomplishing the goal (G), which is implied by T." (HjÃ¸rland & Sejer
Christensen,2002) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance]

For Example

                    A (The Bible)
                    |
                    |
                    v
         ---T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-->G (The Goal)
               (The Task)

If what we learn from the Bible changes what we do on a day to day basis in
some way that has an impact on us reaching a certain goal, we can say that the
Bible was relevant to that goal.

When we ask "Is the Bible relevant?", we have to first ask "what is your
goal?" Possible goals may be happiness, a successful career, lasting
relationships, a ministry of some kind, etc [this needs work!]. These
are not bad goals. The Bible, if studied in light of these goals, does
seem to offer much applicable advice.  Many people have done many good things
by "applying" the Bible to the realization of thier goals. We can say that
the Bible was "relevant" to these people. It made a difference in their life; it
helped them achieve something.

So where's the rub? The problem is that this misses the entire point of the
Bible.  This book is not a book about our goals. It is a book about God's
goals. To talk about the relevance of the Bible in the truest sense, we must
understand what goals the Author had in mind. Anything less means that
we really don't understand the book. To talk about the relevance of something
we don't understand is really just to pick out some things that we like while
ignoroing the real message.

What is God's goal according to the Bible? To answer this, we need to take a
look at the big picture painted by the Book.

The Big Picture
---------------

Genesis: Tree of Life, Adam and Eve
Revelation: Tree, The Lamb and The Bride
