A study on cup (Hannah and I looked at this on July 4, 2016)

- "cup" appears 33 times in the NT
- Appears to be associated with a calling or purpose God gives out as well as wrath of God
- Need to study closely the passages on communion/fellowship
- How does "fellowship of His sufferings" in Phil 3:10 relate to cup and communion?
