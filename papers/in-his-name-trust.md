In His Name: Trust
==================

The book of Acts is a testimony of the outworking of authority that Christ gave to His followers. In it we read about preaching, healing, and deliverance, all done "in His name". In short, it is a book of works done "in His name".

Two specific instances where the name of Jesus was invoked stand out in great contrast. One of these is found later in the book in chapter 19.

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [ref]

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession [ref check]. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists, no doubt, had seen the powerful signs wrought through the name of Jesus and desired to apply this higher power to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind.

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [ref]

Here the name of Jesus was invoked but authority was totally lacking. The results were devistating. The problem was not that Jesus hadn't made the authority available to His followers. In fact, the evil spirit specifically recognized Paul, who is seen successfully casting out an evil spirit in the name of Jesus just a few chapters earlier [ref].

And we find many other signs throughout the book of Acts being worked out by more than just the twelve disciples. In Mark, Jesus explains the signs that will be done in His name by His followers.

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The critical link is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is only by faith that this authority is received. This is not a mere belief in the existence or power of Jesus, which the exorcists no doubt had. It is a firm convinction of who He really is  leading to a trust in Him. When Jesus asked Peter  "But who do you say that I am?" [Mar 8:29 ESV], Peter's response was not "a good teacher" or "a propher" but simply "You are the Christ." The word Peter used was Messiah. For Peter, this meant He was the Anoinetd One, the Son of God sent to save Israel and ultimately fulfill all promises God had in store for that nation. And just as when he had taken first steps in following Jesus at the Sea of Galilee, his trust was in Him still. This trust was both in the person of Christ and in the specific mission He had for His followers at that time.

Peter invokes the name of Jesus himself early in the book of Acts when happening upon the crippled person at the entrance to the Temple


> In the name of Jesus ... [ref]


He then goes on to explain how it was faith in Christ that made this possible.

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

The basis of everything Peter did was faith in The Messiah.

- The basis - faith in Jesus as Messiah, the Son of God, was the basis of the work done in His name. Just a few versus earlier in the chapter, Peter was clearly explaining who Jesus was.
- The power - healing was not done by Peter nor was it a result of Peter's faith. This healing was the power of the Son of God at work.
- The source - faith was ultimately given from the Father, but it was through the Son. ("flesh and blood hath not revelaed this" and also see Mat 11:27)

Trust

Some type of a summary. Any links to trust in Eph or Col?
