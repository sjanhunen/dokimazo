In His Name: Trust
==================

The book of Acts is a record of works done in the name of Jesus. We read about preaching, healing, and deliverance, all done "in His name". It is the outworking of the authority Christ gave His disciples for proclaiming the good news of the kingdom.

One incident in Acts Chapter 19 stands out in great contract to the others in the book.

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [ref]

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists had seen or heard of the powerful works done by Paul in the name of Jesus and desired to apply it to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind.

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [ref]

Here the name of Jesus was invoked but authority was totally lacki ng. The results were devestating. The problem was not that the authority to cast out demons wasn't available. In fact, Christ clearly said that this authority extended much futher than the twelve.

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The missing link is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is only by faith that the authority for this power can be received. This is not a mere belief in the existence of Jesus, which the exorcists no doubt had. It is a firm conviction of who He really is. The context of Mark 16 is the resurrection of Christ. Here "believe" means belief in Christ as the resurrected Messiah.

In Acts chapter 3, Peter illustrates belief in the resurrected Christ as the basis for work done "in His name". When entering the temple for prayer with John, they encounter a man lame from birth at the gate.

> Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. [Acts 3:6 KJV]

The name of Jesus was invoked and the power followed. Peter goes on to explain the healing to the people at the temple.

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

It was the power of Christ at work here: His Name stands for His authority. This time, the basis of faith was present. The faith here is not the lame man's, it is Peter's trust in the resurrected Christ.

Trust in the resurrected Christ is central to all of God's purposes. God invites to be a part of His purpose, but without a response of trust, there really can be no relationship. There isn't power in His name if there is no relationship with Him.
