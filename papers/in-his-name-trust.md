In His Name: Trust
==================

Doing something "in the name of Jesus" implies doing something with all that His name stands for: the authority and power of Jesus. But how is this authority received? Is merely invoking His name all that is required?

In Acts 19, we find a striking application of the name of Jesus:

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession [ref check]. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists, no doubt, had seen the powerful signs wrought through the name of Jesus and desired to apply this higher power to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

In this case, the name of Jesus was invoked but real power and authority were totally lacking. The results were devistating. These men were trying to apply something that didn't belong to them.

The disciples, on the other hand, were most certainly authorized to exercise this power

> And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
[Mat 10:1 ESV]

And we find them doing exactly these things in the book of Acts. This authority extended further than just the immediate 12 disciples, as we can see Jesus explaining in Mark

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The critical link here is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is by faith that this authority and power is received. This is not a mere belief in the existence of Jesus, but a convinction of who He really is. When Jesus asked Peter  "But who do you say that I am?" [Mar 8:29 ESV], Peter's response was not "a good teacher" or "a propher" but simply "You are the Christ." Peter knew that Christ was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Son of God.

The fact that the name of Jesus must be invoked by faith is summed up concisely in Acts 3, when Peter is explaining the healing of the lame man to the crowd at the temple

> And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Acts 3:16 ESV]

The rendering of this verse in NASB prooves helpful for understanding

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

There are three components to Peter's explanation of the healing of the lame man:
- The basis - faith in Jesus as Messiah, the Son of God, is the basis of any work done in His name. Peter is clearly explaining who Jesus was in the preceding verses.
- The power - the healing was not done by Peter nor was it a result of Peter's faith. This was the power of the Son of God at work.
- The source - faith was ultimately given from the Father, but it was through the Son. ("flesh and blood hath not revelaed this" and also see Mat 11:27)
