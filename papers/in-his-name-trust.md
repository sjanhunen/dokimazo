In His Name: Trust
==================

The book of Acts is a record of works done in the name of Jesus. We read about preaching, healing, and deliverance, all done "in His name". It is the outworking of the authority Christ gave His disciples for proclaiming the good news of the kingdom.

One incident in Acts Chapter 19 stands out in great contract to the others in the book.

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [ref]

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession [ref check]. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists had seen or heard of the powerful works done through the name of Jesus by Paul and to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind.

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [ref]

Here the name of Jesus was invoked but authority was totally lacking. The results were devistating. The problem was not that Jesus hadn't made the authority available to His followers. The book of Acts is filled with being worked out by more than just the twelve disciples. In Mark, Jesus explains what was missing here.

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The critical link is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is only by faith that the authority for this power can be received. This is not a mere belief in the existence of Jesus, which the exorcists no doubt had. It is a firm conviction of who He really is and of the reality of His resurrection. The resurreciton of Christ is the context of Mark 16 and it is the belief here in view.

The link between resurrection and the name of Jesus comes into view in Acts 3, where Peter 


> In the name of Jesus ... [ref]


He then goes on to explain how it was faith in Christ that made this possible.

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

The basis of everything Peter did was faith in The Messiah. Just a few versus earlier in the chapter, Peter was clearly explaining who Jesus was. The healing was not done by Peter nor was it a result of Peter's faith. This healing was the power of the Son of God at work. Faith was ultimately given from the Father, but it was through the Son. ("flesh and blood hath not revelaed this" and also see Mat 11:27)
