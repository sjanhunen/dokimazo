In His Name: Purpose
====================

So often the good news of the gospel is presented as an opportunity for us to invite Christ into our lives. This may leave us thinking we have the power to initiate this relationship. But this is completely upsidedown. In fact, we are [powerless][1] to do this. Our relationship with Christ is not initiated by [us first seeking Him][2]: He is the one that seeks out us. He invites us to become part of His life and purpose.

This is seen clearly in the example of Christ calling His disciples as He began His earthly ministry. Walking by the Sea of Galilee, he encountered two brothers that were fishermen.

> And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." And they straightway left [their] nets, and followed him. [Mat 4:19 ESV]

Christ is the one who extended the offer. He was the one that found Peter and Andrew, not the other way around. Not only did He invite them to follow Him, He hinted at the bigger purpose He had for them: becoming "fishers of men" for His kingdom. We can debate what exactly went through their minds as they accepted the invitation or what they may or may not have known about who Jesus was at that instant. But we cannot debate the simple fact that they accepted and followed.

Christ Had received authority from the Father for His ministry. He called the twelve together and gave them authority to be witnesses for Him.

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. [Luke 9:1-2 ESV]

The works that we see the twelve and others doing during the gospels and book of Acts are possible because of the authority given for this purpose. The authority in proclaiming the kingdom that He shared with His disciples was in anticipation of the future realization of that kingdom on earth, when they would rule together in that kingdom.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Mat 19:28 ESV]

This emphasis on Purpose is not to minimize the importance of redemption and forgiveness in any way. In fact, this serves to highlight the very necessity of it. In Ephesians, we see just how closely redemption and purpose are aligned in God's plans.

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. [Eph 1:7-10 ESV]

Here redemption, forgiveness, and grace all come together according to His purpose.

Redemption is always for a purpose. To present the gospel in any other way is to present an incomplete gospel. The preaching of the Kingdom was always about a specific plan that God had for Isral. This is important, but it is only a piece of the "bigger picture".

When we become part of Christ's purpose, we share in His authority in some way. Christ's authority extends far above and beyond the earthly sphere.

> far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church [Eph 1:21-22 ESV]


Notes
-----

Think briefly about 'Entering the Kingdom', born again, and flesh and blood.

> Jhn 9:39 KJV - And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

How do you see Christ? What is your relationship to Him?
