In His Name: Purpose
====================

So often the good news of the gospel is presented as an opportunity for us to invite Christ into our lives. This may leave us thinking we have the power to initiate this relationship. But this is completely upsidedown. In fact, we are [powerless][1] to do this. Our relationship with Christ is not initiated by [us first seeking Him][2]: He is the one that seeks out us. He invites us to become part of His life and purpose.

This is seen clearly in the example of Christ calling His disciples as He began His earthly ministry. Walking by the Sea of Galilee, he encountered two brothers that were fishermen.

> And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." And they straightway left [their] nets, and followed him. [Mat 4:19 ESV]

Christ is the one who extended the offer. He was the one that found Peter and Andrew, not the other way around. Not only did He invite them to follow Him, He hinted at the bigger purpose He had for them: becoming "fishers of men" for His kingdom. We can debate what exactly went through their minds as they accepted the invitation or what they may or may not have known about who Jesus was at that instant. But we cannot debate the simple fact that they accepted and followed. Their trust in Jesus began here as they took their first steps with Him.

After finding and gathering the twelve together, Christ gave them the authority for their ministry, much like the Father had given Him authority for His.

> And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. [Mat 10:1 ESV]

The experience or credentials of the twelve did not qualify them for this authority. 

The works that we see the twelve and others doing during the gospels and book of Acts are possible because of the authority given for this purpose. The authority in proclaiming the kingdom that He shared with His disciples was in anticipation of the future realization of that kingdom on earth, when they would rule together in that kingdom. The preaching of the Kingdom was always about a specific plan that God had for Isral.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Mat 19:28 ESV]

This emphasis on purpose is not to minimize the importance of redemption and forgiveness in any way. In fact, this serves to highlight the very necessity of it. In Ephesians, we see just how interconnected redemption and purpose truly are.

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. [Eph 1:7-10 ESV]

Redemption, forgiveness, and grace all come together according to His purpose. To present the good news without His purpose is to present an incomplete gospel.

Long before Christ ever invited Peter to follow Him, Israel was redeemed from Egypt. Without this redemption from bondage, long before in history, it would have been impossible for Peter to be fishing on the Sea of Galilee, ready for this encounder with Jesus. 

When it comes to purpose and redemption, there can be no doubt that God makes the first move.

> Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed [us] into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. [Col 1:12-14 NKJV]

It is always God that qualifies for the authority that He gives. Redemption is always for a purpose - it looks forward to inheritance and authority. Tie back to "in His Name".
