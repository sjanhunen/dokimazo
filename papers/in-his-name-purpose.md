In His Name: Purpose
====================

It is difficult to imagine authority existing outside the context of a relationship. An employer without employees, a mayor without a city, a president without a country - these are all incomplete.

Still thinking of Christ during His earthly ministry.

"follow me" to the 12. What did this relationship look like?

Notice that Christ initiated the relationship. He found them, they didn't find Him. Some may struggle with putting relationship before faith, but the simple fact is that God seeks us, not the other way around. 

The Shepherd seeking out the lost sheep.

The signs were for a specific reason.

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons..."


- Matt 7:21-22 - not everyone who says Lord Lord
- Luke 6:46 - the house built upon rock and the house built upon sand
- Luke 9:1-4 - Jesus gave disciples authority and power
- Mark 9:38-9:40
- If devils are cast out by the spirit of God, the kingdom of heaven is at hand

"You received without paying; give without pay."

Christ on earth - the Messiah of Israel, the King of the Jews. This relationship had to be put right before the rest of the world could follow.

> Rom 5:6 NASB - For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.

This was a relationship with purpose. Recall Judgment and see how the 12 fit into this.

> Mat 4:19 NASB - And He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."

> Mat 19:28 NASB - And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the > Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”

How do you see Christ? What is your relationship to Him?

> Col 2:9 NASB - For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,
> Col 2:10 NASB - and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;

This is way bigger than Israel and the earth.
