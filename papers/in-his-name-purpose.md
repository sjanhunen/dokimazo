In His Name: Purpose
====================

So often the good news of the gospel is presented as an opportunity for us to invite Christ into our lives. This makes it seem as if we have the power to initiate this relationship. It suggest we are still somehow in control of our destiny. But this is completely upsidedown. In fact, we are [powerless][1] to do this. Our relationship with Christ is not initiated by [us first seeking Him][2]: He is the one that seeks out us. And He invites us to become part of His life and purpose.

We need to look no futher than the example of Christ calling His disciples to see this clearly.

> Mat 4:19 ESV - And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."

Notice that Christ initiated the relationship. He found them; they didn't find Him. 

A core purpose of Christ's ministry on earth was being a life-giving judge

> Jhn 9:39 KJV - And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

This purpose extended to the others that followed him. We clearly see this in the 

> Mat 19:28 NASB - And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

The purpose started with Israel, and only after this was going to be extended out to the world. Christ on earth - the Messiah of Israel, the King of the Jews. This relationship had to be put right before the rest of the world could follow.

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons..."


This is way bigger than Israel and the earth. Look at the purpose of the church in Ephesians. Think of Ephesians as the purpose book and Colossians as the faithfulness book.

> Eph 1:7 ESV - In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,

> Eph 1:8 ESV - which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight

> Eph 1:9 ESV - making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ

> Eph 1:10 ESV - as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

Notice that the redemption is always for a purpose. To present the gospel any other way is to present an incomplete gospel.

> Eph 1:21 ESV - far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

> Eph 1:22 ESV - And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,

Name above every name! The purpose and authority we share as the body of Christ.
How close we are with Him as members of His body! Think about how close the disciples were and how close we are as members of His body.

How do you see Christ? What is your relationship to Him?
