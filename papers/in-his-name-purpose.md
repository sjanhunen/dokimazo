In His Name: Purpose
====================

Notice that Christ initiated the relationship. He found them; they didn't find Him. So often, the good news of the gospel is presented as an opportunity for us to invite Christ into our lives. But this is completely backwards. We don't invite Him, He invites us. He wants us to be a part of His purpose and His life. This is what happened for the disciples while He was on earth, and this is what is still happening with us today while Christ is in heaven.

> Mat 4:19 ESV - And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."


A core purpose of Christ's ministry on earth was being a life-giving judge

> Jhn 9:39 KJV - And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

This purpose extended to the others that followed him. We clearly see this in the 

> Mat 19:28 NASB - And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Just as Jesus received authority from the Father, He gave authority to His disciples to be witnesses for Him

> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. (Luke 9:1-2 ESV)

The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”

The purpose started with Israel, and only after this was going to be extended out to the world. Christ on earth - the Messiah of Israel, the King of the Jews. This relationship had to be put right before the rest of the world could follow.

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons..."

In Colossians, we read about Christ fulfilling a role that is way bigger than just 

> Col 2:9 NASB - For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,

> Col 2:10 NASB - and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;

This is way bigger than Israel and the earth.

Look at the purpose of the church in Ephesians. Think of Ephesians as the purpose book and Colossians as the faithfulness book.

> Eph 1:9 ESV - making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ
> Eph 1:10 ESV - as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
> Eph 1:11 ESV - In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,


Notice that the redemption is for a purpose!

> Eph 1:21 ESV - far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

Name above every name!

How close we are with Him as members of His body!




> Rom 8:28 ESV - And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.

> Rom 5:6 NASB - For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.


How do you see Christ? What is your relationship to Him?
