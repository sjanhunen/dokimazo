In His Name: Relationship
=========================

Still thinking of Christ during His earthly ministry.

"follow me" to the 12. What did this relationship look like?

Notice that Christ initiated the relationship. He found them, they didn't find Him.

This was a relationship with purpose. Recall Judgment and see how the 12 fit into this.

> Mat 4:19 NASB - And He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."

> Mat 19:28 NASB - And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the > Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
