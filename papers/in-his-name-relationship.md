In His Name: Relationship
=========================

Still thinking of Christ during His earthly ministry.

"follow me" to the 12. What did this relationship look like?

Notice that Christ initiated the relationship. He found them, they didn't find Him.

This was a relationship with purpose. Recall Judgment and see how the 12 fit into this.
