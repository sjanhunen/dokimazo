In His Name
===========

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'?

A [Google image search][1] on "In Jesus Name" shows that this phrase has been applied to many thingsin many ways.

But what did Paul have in mind when he wrote these words in Colossians?

> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. [Col 3:17 ESV]

This is all encompassing: it covers everything we do in both word and deed. Somehow, all of this is to be done "in the name of the Lord Jesus".

The first hint is the word "Lord", which is the word for master, or one in authority. The intention is not merely to include His name like a signature, but to somehow invoke the authority and power of Jesus. In other words, His name is used to represent His authority. 

> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. [Phl 2:10 ESV]

To fully appreciate what it means to do something in the name or the authority of Christ, we must first understand the authority of Christ Himself.
