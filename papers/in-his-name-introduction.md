In His Name
===========

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? Perhaps you conclude your prayers "in Jesus name" without giving much thought to the significance of the phrase. We realize that when something is done or said "in His name", the intention is not merely to include His name like a signature, but to somehow invoke the authority and power of Jesus. In other words, His name is used to represent His authority. To fully appreciate what it means to do something in the name or the authority of Christ, we must first understand the authority of Christ Himself. And we must understand how He received this authority.
