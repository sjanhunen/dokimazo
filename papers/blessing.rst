Hebrew word "barak" H1288
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [Gen 1:22, 28 KJV] 22 And God blessed[H1288] them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. ... 28 And God blessed[H1288] them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
* [Gen 2:3 KJV] 3 And God blessed[H1288] the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
* [Gen 5:2 KJV] 2 Male and female created he them; and blessed[H1288] them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
* [Gen 9:1 KJV] 1 And God blessed[H1288] Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
* [Gen 12:2-3 KJV] 2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless[H1288] thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 3 And I will bless[H1288] them that bless[H1288] thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.[H1288]
* [Gen 17:16, 20 KJV] 16 And I will bless[H1288] her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless[H1288] her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be of her. ... 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed[H1288] him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
* [Gen 22:17 KJV] 17 That in blessing[H1288] I will bless[H1288] thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which [is] upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
* [Gen 24:1, 35 KJV] 1 And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed[H1288] Abraham in all things. ... 35 And the LORD hath blessed[H1288] my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
* [Gen 25:11 KJV] 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed[H1288] his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
* [Gen 26:3, 12, 24 KJV] 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless[H1288] thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; ... 12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed[H1288] him. ... 24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless[H1288] thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are all blessed by God. But what is different about each? Abraham demonstrated faith. Issac tricked his father about the birthright. What about blessing of God? And Jacob wrestled with God over the blessing.
