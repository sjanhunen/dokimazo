In His Name: Authority
======================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'?

A [Google image search][1] on "In Jesus Name" reveals that name of Jesus has been applied to everything from prayer to fashion accessories.

But what did Paul have in mind when he wrote these words in Colossians?

> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. [Col 3:17 ESV]

This is all encompassing: it covers everything we do in both word and deed. If we get this wrong, our words and our actions will be built on the wrong foundation.

The first key to understanding "In His Name" is the word "Lord". This is the word for master, or one in authority. The intention here is not merely to include His name like a signature or an endorsement, but to somehow invoke the authority behind His name.

This is clear in Philippians, where Paul writes

> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. [Phl 2:10 ESV]

In other words, His name is used to represent His authority as Lord.

The second key to understanding what it means to do something "in His name" comes from studying the example of Christ Himself. Backing up just a few verses we read

> Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. [Phl 2:5-7 NASB]

Even though Christ was equal with God, it was the form of a servant that He took upon Himself when he ministered on earth in the flesh. And His obedience ultimately went as far as death on a cross. As a result of this faithful service Paul says

> For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name [Phl 2:9 NASB]

In God's path to glory, the humbled servant precedes the exalted Lord. The more we understand the the relationship Christ had with His Father, the more we will appreciate what it means to do something "in His name".

In His Name: The Father and the Son
===================================

The authority of Jesus was questioned by the Jewish religious leaders on multiple occasions. Often, in answer to this, Jesus would respond with [questions of His own][1] or by appealing to the witness of others. But in an encounter recorded in the gospel of John, we find one of the most direct expositions on authority in the words of Christ Himself.

On a journey to Jerusalem, [Jesus finds a lame man][3] by the pool called Bethesda and heals him, commanding him to get up, take his bed mat, and walk. The catch is that this healing took place on the Sabbath. When the Jews heard of this they promptly accused Jesus of breaking the Law of the Sabbath - first, by [healing on the Sabbath][5], and second, by commanding the man to [carry his mat on the Sabbath][6].

When confronted about this, Jesus does not enter into a detailed discourse on the law or the Sabbath. Instead, He simply begins to explain His relationship with His Father.

> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working." [John 5:17 ESV]

He makes clear the link to His Father and in doing so identifies Himself as the Son of God. If His "breaking of the Sabbath" were enough to anger these Jews, calling God His father takes things to a whole new level.

He goes on to speak in detail of this relationship.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [John 5:19-20 ESV]

How tempting it is to think that Jesus, being God in flesh, had no need to learn from anyone or answer to anyone. Here we see that this is not the case. As a faithful servant and son, He learned everything from His Father. He did nothing that was outside of His Father's plan. First and foremost, He did not take the authority He had for Himself: he received it from the Father.

> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son ... he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [Jhn 5:22-27 ESV]

The Son always exercises his judgment by faith. That is, it is [based on what He hears][7] from the Father. Unlike the judgment of the Jewish leaders, which was often [based on thier traditions][11], His judgment was always based solidly on the Word of God in alignment with the Will of God.

> I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [Jhn 5:30 ESV]

This close relationship between the Father and the Son illustrates three essential aspects of any relationship:

1. Purpose - the Father gave the Son authority to judge
2. Trust - the Son executed His authority through faith in the Father's Word
3. Faithfulness - the Son lived in perfect obedience to the Father's will

All three of these are brought to a concise summary by Jesus Himself.

> I have come in my Father's name [Jhn 5:43 ESV]

These are the words of a faithful servant. For Christ, this meant nothing less than fulfilling the purpose the Father had given to Him.

In His Name: Purpose
====================

So often the good news of the gospel is presented as an opportunity for us to invite Christ into our lives. This may leave us thinking we have the power to initiate this relationship. But this is completely upsidedown. In fact, we are [powerless][1] to do this. Our relationship with Christ is not initiated by [us first seeking Him][2]: He is the one that seeks out us. He invites us to become part of His life and purpose.

This is seen clearly in the example of Christ calling His disciples as He began His earthly ministry. Walking by the Sea of Galilee, he encountered two brothers that were fishermen.

> And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." And they straightway left [their] nets, and followed him. [Mat 4:19 ESV]

Christ is the one who extended the offer. He was the one that found Peter and Andrew, not the other way around. Not only did He invite them to follow Him, He hinted at the bigger purpose He had for them: becoming "fishers of men" for His kingdom. We may ponder what exactly went through their minds as they accepted the invitation or what they may or may not have known about Jesus at that instant. But we cannot debate the simple fact that they accepted and followed. Their trust in Jesus began here as they took their first steps with Him.

After finding and gathering the twelve together, Christ gave them the authority for their ministry, much like the Father had given Him authority for His.

> And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. [Mat 10:1 ESV]

The works that we see the twelve and others doing during the gospels and book of Acts are possible because of the authority given for this purpose. The authority in proclaiming the kingdom that He shared with His disciples was in anticipation of the future realization of that kingdom on earth, when they would rule together in that kingdom. 

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Mat 19:28 ESV]

This emphasis on purpose is not to minimize the importance of redemption in any way. In fact, the regeneration and the new world that Jesus speaks of here are completely impossible without redemption.

In Ephesians, Paul brings redemption and purpose together when he is summarizing God's plan for the fullness of time.

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. [Eph 1:7-10 ESV]

Redemption, forgiveness, and grace all come together according to the Father's purpose. To present the good news without His purpose is to present an incomplete gospel. Just as Christ invited His disciples to follow Him in His earthly ministry, He is inviting us to be a part of what He is doing in His heavenly ministry. 

In His Name: Trust
==================

The book of Acts is a record of works done in the name of Jesus. We read about preaching, healing, and deliverance, all done "in His name". It is the outworking of the authority Christ gave His disciples for proclaiming the good news of the kingdom.

One incident in Acts Chapter 19 stands out in great contract to the others in the book.

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [ref]

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists had seen or heard of the powerful works done by Paul in the name of Jesus and desired to apply it to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind.

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [ref]

Here the name of Jesus was invoked but authority was totally lacki ng. The results were devestating. The problem was not that the authority to cast out demons wasn't available. In fact, Christ clearly said that this authority extended much futher than the twelve.

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The missing link is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is only by faith that the authority for this power can be received. This is not a mere belief in the existence of Jesus, which the exorcists no doubt had. It is a firm conviction of who He really is. The context of Mark 16 is the resurrection of Christ. Here "believe" means belief in Christ as the resurrected Messiah.

In Acts chapter 3, Peter illustrates belief in the resurrected Christ as the basis for work done "in His name". When entering the temple for prayer with John, they encounter a man lame from birth at the gate.

> Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. [Acts 3:6 KJV]

The name of Jesus was invoked and the power followed. Peter goes on to explain the healing to the people at the temple.

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

It was the power of Christ at work here: His Name stands for His authority. This time, the basis of faith was present. The faith here is not the lame man's, it is Peter's trust in the resurrected Christ.

Trust in the resurrected Christ is central to all of God's purposes. God invites to be a part of His purpose, but without a response of trust, there really can be no relationship. There isn't power in His name if there is no relationship with Him.

In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================

The phrase "enter the Kingdom" is often used as a way to describe personal salvation. When someone puts their trust in Christ, they are said to have "entered the kingdom". But when we look at how this phrase is actually used by Christ, a different picture begins to emerge.

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [Mat 7:21 ESV]

Entering the kingdom was not just about identifying Jesus as Lord, it was about doing the will of His Father. Above and beyond faith alone, this required works. This was a warning to those who were believers, not to those who didn't trust Christ in the first place.

> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.' [Mat 7:22-23 ESV]

There is no indication that the works done here were not genuine. In fact, these were the very signs that were support to follow them that believed. And yet, entrance to the kingdom was denied.

Christ further explains this with the illustration of the wise and foolish builders.

> "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [Mat 7:24-26 ESV]

Again, the example of the builder illustrates the fact that works are in view here, not just faith alone. They are each building something, but on very different foundations. The question is whether the works will stand when tested. What are the words that Christ is referring to here? Just a few versus earlier in this chapter we get a concise summary.

> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. [Mat 7:12 KJV]

Christ didn't come to abolish the law, he came to fulfill it. He has summed up the law in a nutshell. Here in Matthew, entering the Kingdom isn't about redemption or initial salvation, it is a reward for faithful service done lawfully. Those entering the kingdom could look forward to ruling with Christ in a position of authority. 

There can be no faithfulness if there is not first faith. The faithful servant aligns himself with the will of God. This is not possible with efforts of the flesh, it requires the very power of God. This is what Christ meant when he said "With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."

In His Name: Conclusion
=======================

Returning to the theme verse once again, we still have to examine the second part of the verse.

> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. [Col 3:17 ESV]

What does giving thanks to God the Father have to do with doing everything "in the name of the Lord Jesus"? Why does Paul mention this here? Looking back to the first chapter of Colossians, we find our answer.

> Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed [us] into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. [Col 1:12-14 NKJV]

It is always God that qualifies those He calls. He has prepared an inheritance and wants us to be part of it. Without redemption, this purpose would not be possible. This is thankfulness for the work He has done to prepare us.

Inheritance is mentioned a second time near the end of Colossians, but this time with a reward in view.

> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. [Col 3:23-25]

There is a difference between being "made meet" for the inheritance and receiving the reward of the inheritance. The difference is doing everything "in His name". This really does touch every aspect of life, because in the preceding verses we see the relationships of husbands and wives, children and parents, and servants and masters (or maybe employees and employers).
