In His Name: Notes
==================

3 keys in our relationship with Christ
--------------------------------------

- Purpose - initiated by God, not by us
- Trust - like a link between purpose and obedience
- Faithfullness - the wise builder building according to God's Will

Illustration: diagram of three circles - purpose, trust, faithfulness. The intersection of all 3 - in His name.

4 Roles of Christ
-----------------

- Prophet
- Judge
- Priest
- King

Each one of these four had a significant role in Israel's history. Christ fulfills them all.


> Jhn 9:39 KJV - And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

- The encounter with the religous leaders in Acts 4 is pretty insightful
- If something is done in the name or authority of Jesus, how is that authority given?

Making Disciples of All Nations: compare Mat 28:19 with Acts 2:5 - isn't the focus Jews out of all nations

Compare the authority in Acts with this:
> Luk 4:18 KJV - The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

Looking at how the phrase "in the name of Jesus" is used in Acts, we see examples of the disciples doing exactly these things:

- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.
