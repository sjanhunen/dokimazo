The classic John 3:16

Jhn 3:16 KJV - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Jhn 3:17 KJV - For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
Jhn 3:18 KJV - He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Here belief in him is equated with belief in the name of the only begotten Son of God. The name of the Son stands for His authority as the Son of God.

Mat 16:13 KJV - When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Mat 16:14 KJV - And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Mat 16:15 KJV - He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Mat 16:16 KJV - And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Mat 16:17 KJV - And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.


Here we see that for Peter, believing that the Son of Man was in fact the Son of God was not an exercise of reason or a matter of argument - it was a revelation from God.


Mat 1:20 KJV - But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
Mat 1:21 KJV - And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
Mat 1:22 KJV - Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
Mat 1:23 KJV - Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.


Christ was the seed of David through His mother Mary, but His Father was God.


1Jo 4:1 KJV - Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
1Jo 4:2 KJV - Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
1Jo 4:3 KJV - And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.


Acknowledgement that Jesus is Christ come in the Flesh is at the core of what is means to be a Christian.
