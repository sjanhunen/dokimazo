John 3:16 is a verse so well known and so often quoted that we seldom take the time to take in the profound truth expressed here.

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

The alternatives presented are perishing and life. The critical link to life is belief in Him. What does this belief look like? Continuing we read

> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Here belief in him is equated with belief in the name of the only begotten Son of God. The name of the Son stands for His authority as the Son of God.


Consider the example of Peter in Acts chapter 3.

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]


3 aspects
- Peter's faith in Christ
- The power of Jesus
- The faith which comes from Him


Mat 16:13 KJV - When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Mat 16:14 KJV - And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Mat 16:15 KJV - He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
Mat 16:16 KJV - And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Mat 16:17 KJV - And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.


Here we see that for Peter, believing that the Son of Man was in fact the Son of God was not an exercise of reason or a matter of argument - it was a revelation from God.

Belief in Him in a nutshell: the Son of man is the Son of God.
