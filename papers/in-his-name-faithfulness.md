In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================

The signs were for a specific reason

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons..."


- Matt 7:21-22 - not everyone who says Lord Lord
- Luke 6:46 - the house built upon rock and the house built upon sand
- Luke 9:1-4 - Jesus gave disciples authority and power
- Mark 9:38-9:40
- If devils are cast out by the spirit of God, the kingdom of heaven is at hand

"You received without paying; give without pay."
Works built without a solid foundaation (God's Will) will not last.

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will:
> Mat 7:21 KJV - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> Mat 7:22 KJV - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> Mat 7:23 KJV - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

Faithfulness as a theme in Colossians

> Col 1:2 KJV - To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

> Col 1:7 KJV - As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

> Col 4:7 KJV - All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

> Col 4:9 KJV - With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here.


Question: How much of what we do in His name is merely building sand castles that will not last?

> Eph 5:1 ESV - Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.

> Eph 5:6 ESV - Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

> Eph 5:17 ESV - Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
