In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================

The phrase "enter the Kingdom" is often understood as a way to describe personal salvation. When someone puts their trust in Christ, they are said to have "entered the kingdom". But when we look at how this phrase is actually used by Christ, a different picture begins to emerge.

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [Mat 7:21-22 ESV]

Entering the kingdom is not just about identifying Jesus as Lord, it is about doing the will of His Father. This is above and beyond faith alone and requires faithful works. It is a warning to those that were believers, not to those that know nothing about God.

> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' [Mat 7:21-22 ESV]

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will. There is no indication that the works done here were not genuine. In fact, these were the signs that followed them that believed.

> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.' [Mat 7:22-23 ESV]

Christ further explains this with the illustration of the wise and foolish builders.

> "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [Mat 7:24-26 ESV]

Works built without a solid foundaation on God's Will will not last. Notice that this is building and works are in view. If anything, this is using God's name in vain. It like taking something He has given for a purpose and squandering it on something that won't last.

In Ephesians, Paul has something to say about wisdom and foolishness that resonates with the lesson of the wise and foolish builders.

> See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, 16 redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord [is]. [Eph 5:15-17 NKJV]

If God's will were something so unfathomable that it could not be summarized in an understandable way, there is no way Paul could make this statement. Looking at the start of this chapter, we get more of the context behind what Paul means when he says "will of the Lord". 

> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. [Eph 5:1-2 ESV]

Faith and knowledge are not the end goal, but they are an absolutely essential means to walking in the will of God. Walking in wisdom is only possible with the wisdom that comes by faith.

> For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. [Eph 5:5 ESV]
