In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================


Key point: redemption is always for a purpose. And that purpose involves sharing in the authority of Christ.

When we become part of Christ's purpose, we share in His authority in some way. 


Works built without a solid foundaation (God's Will) will not last.

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will:
> Mat 7:21 KJV - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> Mat 7:22 KJV - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> Mat 7:23 KJV - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

- Matt 7:21-22 - not everyone who says Lord Lord
- Luke 6:46 - the house built upon rock and the house built upon sand
- Luke 9:1-4 - Jesus gave disciples authority and power
- Mark 9:38-9:40
- If devils are cast out by the spirit of God, the kingdom of heaven is at hand


> far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[Eph 1:21-23 ESV]

Christ's authority extends far above and beyond the earthly sphere and is far bigger than rule over the twelve tribes or the earth.

Question: How much of what we do in His name is merely building sand castles that will not last?

> Eph 5:1 ESV - Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.

> Eph 5:6 ESV - Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

> Eph 5:17 ESV - Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

Sons of disobedience - who are they? Likely believers who do now understand and follow the will of God.

Think about Jacob and Esau and what God hates.


Faithfulness as a theme in Colossians

> Col 1:2 KJV - To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

> Col 1:7 KJV - As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

> Col 4:7 KJV - All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

> Col 4:9 KJV - With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here.
