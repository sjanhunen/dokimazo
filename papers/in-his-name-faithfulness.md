In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================

The phrase "enter the Kingdom" is often used as a way to describe personal salvation. When someone puts their trust in Christ, they are said to have "entered the kingdom". But when we look at how this phrase is actually used by Christ, a different picture begins to emerge.

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [Mat 7:21 ESV]

Entering the kingdom was not just about identifying Jesus as Lord, it was about doing the will of His Father. Above and beyond faith alone, this required works. This was a warning to those who were believers, not to those who didn't trust Christ in the first place.

> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.' [Mat 7:22-23 ESV]

There is no indication that the works done here were not genuine. In fact, these were the very signs that were support to follow them that believed. And yet, entrance to the kingdom was denied.

Christ further explains this with the illustration of the wise and foolish builders.

> "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [Mat 7:24-26 ESV]

Again, the example of the builder illustrates the fact that works are in view here, not just faith alone. They are each building something, but on very different foundations. The question is whether the works will stand when tested. What are the words that Christ is referring to here? Just a few versus earlier in this chapter we get a concise summary.

> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. [Mat 7:12 KJV]

Christ didn't come to abolish the law, he came to fulfill it. He has summed up the law in a nutshell. Here in Matthew, entering the Kingdom isn't about redemption or initial salvation, it is a reward for faithful service done lawfully. Those entering the kingdom could look forward to ruling with Christ in a position of authority. 

There can be no faithfulness if there is not first faith. The faithful servant aligns himself with the will of God. This is not possible with efforts of the flesh, it requires the very power of God. This is what Christ meant when he said "With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
