In His Name: Faithfulness
=========================

The phrase "enter the Kingdom" is often used to describe initial salvation. But ...

 > "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' [Mat 7:21-22 ESV]

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will. There is no indication that the works were not genuine. In fact, these signs were the signs that followed them that believed.

> "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [Mat 7:24-26 ESV]

Works built without a solid foundaation on God's Will will not last. Notice that this is building and works are in view. If anything, this is using God's name in vain. It like taking something He has given for a purpose and squandering it on something that won't last.


Question: How much of what we do in His name is merely building sand castles that will not last?


> Eph 5:17 ESV - Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.


[Eph 5:5 ESV] 5 For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.


Made meet for the inheritance versus taking hold of the inheritance.
In Colossians, we read how we have been made able to partake of the inheritance. This reward is received.


> Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed [us] into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. [Col 1:12-14 NKJV]


Inheritance is mentioned twice in Colossians. First, it is the Father that qualifies us for the inheritance. And then we receive the reward of the inheritance. 

Think about Jacob and Esau and what God hates. Squandering what He has given for a purpose.

Bring it back to redemption for a purpose. And that purpose involves sharing in the authority and inheritance of Christ.


It is always God that qualifies for the authority that He gives. Redemption is always for a purpose - it looks forward to inheritance and authority. Tie back to "in His Name".
