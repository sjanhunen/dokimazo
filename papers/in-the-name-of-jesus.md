What does it mean to do something 'in the name' of Jesus? How often the phrase "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" is used, often without any though as to its significance.

Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament has this to say about the word name (onoma [G3686] in the Greek)

> for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers

Examples of things done "In the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous)
- Baptizing - "Repent and be baptized" Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing - "Rise up and walk" Peter and John to the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching - "Speak nor teach" The council's threats to Peter and John (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits (Acts 16:18)


Notes
=====
- If something is done in the name or authority of Jesus, how is that authority given?
