In His Name: Authority
==========================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? How often have you heard a phrase like "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" used without any real though given to its significance? How many things have been done "in the name of God" that really have nothing to do with Him and His purposes?

According to Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament, the word name (onoma in the Greek), can be used in the following ways

1. name: univ. of proper names
2. for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers
3. persons reckoned up by name
4. the cause or reason named: on this account, because he suffers as a Christian, for this reason

Whlie a simple proper name is the most common usage of this word, what we are considering here is definitely more aligned with the second meaning: a figurative use that represents the authority and power behind the name.

The book of Acts contains a number of excellent examples of the phrase "in the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous). Throughout this book, we see the Apostles
- Baptizing in the name of Jesus - Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus.

Further points:
- John 10:25 - Christ did works in His Father's name
- Phil 2:10-11 - at the name of Jesus every knee should bow
- John 5:43 - I am come in my Father's name
- Mark 1:27 - He commanded the unclean spirits with authority

In His Name: Faith
=======================

Doing something "in the name of Jesus" implies doing something with all that His name stands for: the authority and power of Jesus. But how is this authority received? Is merely invoking His name all that is required?

In Acts 19, we find a striking application of the name of Jesus:

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.

The term exorcist was applied to those who followed a formulaic approach to casting out deamons as a profession [ref check]. Typically this would be done by either finding out the name of the evil spirit and commanding it to leave by name, or invoking the name of a higher power to command it to leave.  These exorcists, no doubt, had seen the powerful signs wrought through the name of Jesus and desired to apply this higher power to their own handiwork. The results were certainly not what they had in mind

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

In this case, the name of Jesus was invoked but real power and authority were totally lacking. The results were devistating. These men were trying to apply something that didn't belong to them.

The disciples, on the other hand, were most certainly authorized to exercise this power

> And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
[Mat 10:1 ESV]

And we find them doing exactly these things in the book of Acts. This authority extended further than just the immediate 12 disciples, as we can see Jesus explaining in Mark

> And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover." [Mark 16:17-18]

The critical link here is the fact that "these signs" follow out of belief. It is by faith that this authority and power is received. This is not a mere belief in the existence of Jesus, but a convinction of who He really is. When Jesus asked Peter  "But who do you say that I am?" [Mar 8:29 ESV], Peter's response was not "a good teacher" or "a propher" but simply "You are the Christ." Peter knew that Christ was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Son of God.

The fact that the name of Jesus must be invoked by faith is summed up concisely in Acts 3, when Peter is explaining the healing of the lame man to the crowd at the temple

> And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Acts 3:16 ESV]

The rendering of this verse in NASB prooves helpful for understanding

> "And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. [Act 3:16 NASB]

There are three components to Peter's explanation of the healing of the lame man:
- The basis - faith in Jesus as Messiah, the Son of God, is the basis of any work done in His name. Peter is clearly explaining who Jesus was in the preceding verses.
- The power - the healing was not done by Peter nor was it a result of Peter's faith. This was the power of the Son of God at work.
- The source - faith was ultimately given from the Father, but it was through the Son. ("flesh and blood hath not revelaed this" and also see Mat 11:27)


In His Name: Purpose
==============================================

The signs were for a specific reason

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons..."


- Matt 7:21-22 - not everyone who says Lord Lord
- Luke 6:46 - the house built upon rock and the house built upon sand
- Luke 9:1-4 - Jesus gave disciples authority and power
- Mark 9:38-9:40
- If devils are cast out by the spirit of God, the kingdom of heaven is at hand

"You received without paying; give without pay."
Works built without a solid foundaation (God's Will) will not last.

In His Name: Glory

Notes
=====
- The encounter with the religous leaders in Acts 4 is pretty insightful
- If something is done in the name or authority of Jesus, how is that authority given?
- Need to do a full review of http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3686&t=KJV

Making Disciples of All Nations: compare Mat 28:19 with Acts 2:5 - isn't the focus Jews out of all nations

Compare the authority in Acts with this:
> Luk 4:18 KJV - The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will:
> Mat 7:21 KJV - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> Mat 7:22 KJV - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> Mat 7:23 KJV - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
