Name stands for authority
==========================

What does it mean to do something 'in the name of Jesus'? How often have you heard a phrase like "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" used without any real though given to its significance? How many things have been done "in the name of God" that really have nothing to do with Him and His purposes?

According to Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament, the word name (onoma in the Greek), can be used in the following ways

1. name: univ. of proper names
2. for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers
3. persons reckoned up by name
4. the cause or reason named: on this account, because he suffers as a Christian, for this reason

Whlie a simple proper name is the most common usage of this word, what we are considering here is definitely more aligned with the second meaning: a figurative use that represents the authority and power behind the name.

The book of Acts contains a number of excellent examples of the phrase "in the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous). Throughout this book, we see the Apostles
- Baptizing in the name of Jesus - Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing in the name of Jesus - Peter and John with the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching in the name of Jesus - Peter and John were threatened to not do this (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus - Paul cast out the spirit of divination from the damsel (Acts 16:18)

In each of these cases, it is clear that real power is manifested in every application of the name of Jesus. So much so, that when Peter is questioned by the high priest after healing the lame man, he is asked "by what power or by what name did you do this?" (Acts 4:7). Peter was clear in his answer: "by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...this man is standing before you well". 


Authority must be given
=======================

Doing something "in the name of Jesus" implies doing something with the authority and power of Jesus, but how is this authority granted? Is invoking the name of Jesus the key to this power?

In Acts 19, we find a striking application of the name of Jesus:

> Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.

These men had clearly seen the power in the name of Jesus witnessed by so many in Acts and had decided to apply some of this to their own handiwork. The result was clertainly not what they had in mind

> But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

Further points:
- Christ and how the Father gave authority to Him
- Christ gave authority to the disciples specifically for what they were doing in Acts
- Not everyone that says Lord, Lord

Notes
=====
- The encounter with the religous leaders in Acts 4 is pretty insightful
- If something is done in the name or authority of Jesus, how is that authority given?

Making Disciples of All Nations: compare Mat 28:19 with Acts 2:5 - isn't the focus Jews out of all nations

Compare the authority in Acts with this:
> Luk 4:18 KJV - The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will:
> Mat 7:21 KJV - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> Mat 7:22 KJV - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> Mat 7:23 KJV - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
