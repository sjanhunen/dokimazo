What does it mean to do something 'in the name' of Jesus? How often the phrase "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" is used, often without any though as to its significance.

Vine's Expository Dictionary of the New Testament has this to say about the word name (onoma [G3686] in the Greek)

> for all that a "name" implies, of authority, character, rank, majesty, power, excellence, etc., of everything that the "name" covers

Examples of things done "In the name of Jesus" (epi onoma lesous)
- Baptizing - "Repent and be baptized" Peter at Penticost (Acts 2:38)
- Healing - "Rise up and walk" Peter and John to the lame man at the temple (Acts 3:6)
- Speaking and teaching - "Speak nor teach" The council's threats to Peter and John (Acts 4:18)
- Casting out evil spirits (Acts 16:18)




Notes
=====
- If something is done in the name or authority of Jesus, how is that authority given?
- Need to do a full review of http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3686&t=KJV

Compare the authority in Acts with this:
> Luk 4:18 KJV - The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

These did things "in the name" of Jesus but not according to the Father's will:
> Mat 7:21 KJV - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> Mat 7:22 KJV - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> Mat 7:23 KJV - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
