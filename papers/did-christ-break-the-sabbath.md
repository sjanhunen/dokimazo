Did Christ Break The Sabbath?
=============================

This was motivated by studying the healing of the lame man in John 5.

The irony here is that the Jewish leaders we judging the only One who actually had the authority to judge. They were accusing the author of the law of breaking His own law. Did Christ actually break the Sabbath? Not only did He clearly state during His ministry that [He was not abolishing the Law][3], he spoke words of judgment to the leadears about what they had done to His law.

> ... So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. [Mat 15:6 ESV]

No doubt this little Sabbath scuffle started by the Jews was more about the things that they had [added to the law][4] than about the actual law of God itself.
