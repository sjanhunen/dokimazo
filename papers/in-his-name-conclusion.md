In His Name: Conclusion
=======================

Returning to the theme verse once again, we still have to examine the second part of the verse.

> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. [Col 3:17 ESV]

What does giving thanks to God the Father have to do with doing everything "in the name of the Lord Jesus"? Why does Paul mention this here? Looking back to the first chapter of Colossians, we find our answer.

> Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed [us] into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. [Col 1:12-14 NKJV]

It is always God that qualifies those He calls. He has prepared an inheritance and wants us to be part of it. Without redemption, this purpose would not be possible. This is thankfulness for the work He has done to prepare us.

Inheritance is mentioned a second time near the end of Colossians, but this time with a reward in view.

> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. [Col 3:23-25]

There is a difference between being "made meet" for the inheritance and receiving the reward of the inheritance. The difference is doing everything "in His name". This really does touch every aspect of life, because in the preceding verses we see the relationships of husbands and wives, children and parents, and servants and masters (or maybe employees and employers).
