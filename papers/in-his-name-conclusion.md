In His Name: Conclusion
=======================

Returning to the theme verse once again, we still have to examine the second part of the verse.

> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. [Col 3:17 ESV]

What does giving thanks have to do with doing everything "in the name of the Lord Jesus"? Why does Paul mention this here? Looking back to the first chapter of Colossians, we find our answer.

> Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed [us] into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. [Col 1:12-14 NKJV]

It is always God that qualifies those He calls. The disciples were not called because of their credentials and neither are we. Wihout redemption, inheritance is impossible.

Inheritance is mentioned twice in Colossians. First, it is the Father that qualifies us for the inheritance. The second mention is regarding the work we do to receive the reward of the inheritance. 

> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, 24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. [Col 3:]

Made meet for the inheritance versus taking hold of the inheritance.
In Colossians, we read how we have been made able to partake of the inheritance. This reward is received.

Think about the difference in receiving or not receiving. Compare to Israel in the wilderness.

> For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. [Eph 5:5 ESV]

Between these two references to inheritance stands the admonition to do "everything in the name of the Lord Jesus". 



The the phrase "in His name" is that of a faithful servant.


Our relationthip with Christ in founded upon purpose. It is the Father's purpose, not ours. God makes the first move and we respond with trust. Only through faith can we ultimately be faithful to the
