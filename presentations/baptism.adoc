Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words
___________________________________________________
"to baptize," primarily a frequentative form of bapto, "to dip," was used among
the Greeks to signify the dyeing of a garment, or the drawing of water by
dipping a vessel into another, etc. Plutarchus uses it of the drawing of wine
by dipping the cup into the bowl (Alexis, 67) and Plato, metaphorically, of
being overwhelmed with questions (Euthydemus, 277 D).
