A brief anthropology of the old and new creations.

| Old Creation      | New Creation
| Temporary         | Eternal
| Shadows           | Reality
| Old Anthropos     | New Anthropos
| Adam              | Christ
| Adam & Eve        | Head & Body
| Israel & Nations  | Bride & Husband

What are the roles of the bride and the husband?

Both John and Paul had special revelations associated with heaven and with the church in the new creation.
John calls the church the "bride". Paul call the church the "husband".
The old creation is at best a picture of what is coming.
Revelation: king, priest, bride
Ephesians: head, warrior, husband

The preparation of the prest can be studied in the baptisms of Aaron and Christ.
The preparation of the warrior is found in Ephesians:

- Washing in water by the word (Eph 5:26-27)
- Put on the armor of God (Eph 6:10-17)
- Given the Sword of the Spirit (Eph 6:17-18)

Theory:

1. The Horse and Rider with Heavenly Armies in Revelation 19 are Christ and the Church of the Husband
2. Those in the First Resurrection in Rev 20:4-6 are the overcomers, the Kings and Priests of the Church of the Bride

The Tribe of Levi was not numbered to go to war by Moses (Numbers 1:3, 47). Did they ever fight?
