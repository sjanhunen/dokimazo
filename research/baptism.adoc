Baptism: A Definition
---------------------

The Greek word for baptism is βαπτίζω (baptizo). Vine's has this to say about baptize.

Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words
___________________________________________________
"to baptize," primarily a frequentative form of bapto, "to dip," was used among
the Greeks to signify the dyeing of a garment, or the drawing of water by
dipping a vessel into another, etc. Plutarchus uses it of the drawing of wine
by dipping the cup into the bowl (Alexis, 67) and Plato, metaphorically, of
being overwhelmed with questions (Euthydemus, 277 D).
___________________________________________________

Two words: "to dip" vs "to baptize".

So while baptize can be used to describe dipping something into water, it means far more than that.
It signifies a permanent change, not just a temporary immersion.
There is no better illustration of this than pickles!

Not to be confused with 907, baptizo. The clearest example that shows the
meaning of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet and physician Nicander, who
lived about 200 B.C. It is a recipe for making pickles and is helpful because
it uses both words. Nicander says that in order to make a pickle, the vegetable
should first be 'dipped' (bapto) into boiling water and then 'baptised'
(baptizo) in the vinegar solution. Both verbs concern the immersing of
vegetables in a solution. But the first is temporary. The second, the act of
baptising the vegetable, produces a permanent change.

How does washing fit into this in Greek meaning? Is this reading too much into baptize? https://goddidntsaythat.com/2010/08/24/q-and-a-the-original-baptism/

The Baptisms of Christ
----------------------

Christ illustrates with three baptisms in His earthly ministry:

- Water
- Spirit
- Death

Is there a relationship with these and the stages of growth that Paul describes in Corinthians?

- Slave
- Child
- Full Grown

Paul as a teacher on Baptism
----------------------------

Paul speaks of baptism more than any other author when we consider all three.

Baptism and The Mystery
-----------------------

In Col, both the circumcision and baptism are accomplished by God, not human hands (Col 2:10-12).
