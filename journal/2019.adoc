== Jan 12, 2019 - Three Questions

Questions to think about as we study the Bible:

1. What are the last four books of the Old Testament?
2. What are the two types of creation in the Bible?
3. Is there really only one Body of Christ?

Thinking about how to "rightly divide" at the highest level:

1. Where does the Old Testament end? What are the last 4 books?
2. Where does the New Testament begin? What happens between the two?

The division between Old Covenant and New Covenant is not in fact a line.
It is a series of mysteries (secret, or hidden things).

Old Covenant | Mystery (With and Without Temple) | New Covenant
