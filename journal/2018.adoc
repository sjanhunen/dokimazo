Feb 4, 2018 - Good Works
------------------------

Col 1:9-10 NKJV
_______________
For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for
you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all
wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you may walk worthy of the Lord,
fully pleasing [Him], being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the
knowledge of God;
_______________

In this prayer of Paul for the Colossians, we learn that it is not possible to
_walk worthy_ in life or be fruitful in _good works_ without being filled with
the _knowledge of His will_.  This wisdom and spiritual understanding comes from
God, and it is received through His Word.

A worthy life of truly good works will always flow out from a true knowledge of
God's will.  While many things may outwardly appear to us as good or  even
worthy, it is ultimately God who is the judge of this.
